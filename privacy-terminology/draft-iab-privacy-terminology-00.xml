    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>
Privacy is a concept that has been debated and argued throughout the last few millennia by all manner of people, including philosophers, psychologists, lawyers, and more recently, computer scientists. Its most striking feature is that nobody seems able to agree upon a precise definition of what it actually is. Every individual, every group, and every culture have their own different views and preconceptions about the concept - some mutually complimentary, some distinctly different. However, it is generally (but not unanimously!) agreed that the protection of privacy is "A Good Thing" and often, people only realize what it was when they feel that they have lost it.
</t>

<t>
Even within the specific content of computing and computer science, there are still many facets to privacy. For example, consideration of privacy in terms of personal information is distinctly different from consideration of privacy in a geographical information sense: in the former a loss of privacy might be framed as the uncontrolled release of personal information without the subject's consent, while in the latter it might be the ability to compute the location of an individual beyond a certain degree of accuracy.
</t>

<t>
In order to discuss privacy in any meaningful way a tightly defined context needs to be elucidated. The specific context of privacy used within this document is that of "personal data", information about an individual stored and/or transmitted electronically in Internet protocols. This context is highly relevant since a lot of work within the IETF involves defining protocols that can potentially transport (either explicitly or implicitly) personal data and can therefore either, by dint of design decisions when creating them, enable either privacy protection or result in privacy breaches. In this specific context, discussions of privacy largely centre around the collection minimisation, the usage, and release of such personal data.
</t>

<t>
Work in this area of privacy and privacy protection over the last few decades has centred on the idea of data minimization; it uses terminologies such as anonymity, unlinkability, unobservability, and pseudonymity. These terms are often used in discussions about the privacy properties of systems.
</t>

<t>
The core principal of data minimization is that the ability for others to collect any personal data should be removed. Often, however, the collection of personal data cannot not be prevented entirely, in which case the goal is to minimize the amount of personal data that can be collected for a given purpose and to offer ways to control the dissemination of personal data.
</t>

<t>
Data minimization is the only generic strategy to enhance individual privacy in cases where valid personal information is used. Other techniques have been proposed and implemented that aim to enhance privacy by providing misinformation (inaccurate or erroneous information, provided usually without conscious effort to mislead or deceive) or disinformation (deliberately false or distorted information provided in order to mislead or deceive). However, these techniques are out of scope for this document. Data minimization is also the only generic strategy to enable unlinkability if we are excluding providing misinformation or disinformation, since all valid personal data inherently provides some linkability.
</t>

<t>
Thus, this document aims to establish a basic lexicon around privacy so that IETF contributors who wish to discuss privacy considerations within their work can do so using terminology consistent across the area. Note that it does not attempt to define all terminology, rather it just establishes terms to some of the most common ideas and concepts. The hope is that this will facilitate document authors to more easily discuss privacy considerations of their work.

<section title="Setting"> 

<t>To keep the setting as simple as possible, usually, we do not distinguish between a human who uses some software and the actual computer program. Usually, we assume that there is a one-to-one relationship between the device running the software that is the scope of Internet protocol development and the human being using that software.</t>

<t>There are various cases when this human-to-software link is not one-to-one. Protocols developed in the IETF typically do not mandate any specific relationship to exist but the typically envisioned uses for a specific protocol may reveal those relationships. For example, multiple hosts used by different persons may be attached to an Internet gateway in a household and from the Internet Service Provider point of view all these devices belong to a single person, the subscriber, which whom the contract was established. Unless there are good reasons to highlight more the more complex one-to-many relationship we suggest to focus the description on the simpler relationship only for editorial reasons. 
</t>

<t>When necessary we use the term initiator and responder to refer to the communication interaction of a protocol. The initiator and responder terminology is used to particularly reflect that many protocols utilize bidirectional communication where both ends send and receive data.
</t>

<t>We assume that the attacker uses all information available to infer (probabilities of) his items of interest (IOIs). These IOIs may be attributes (and their values) of personal data or actions like who did send or receive which messages.</t>
   
</section> 


    <!-- **************************************************************************************** -->
    <section anchor="anonymity" title="Anonymity">
      <t>To enable anonymity of a subject, there always has to be an appropriate set of subjects
        with potentially the same attributes.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Definition:">Anonymity of a subject from an attacker's perspective means that the attacker 
            cannot sufficiently identify the subject within a set of subjects, the anonymity set.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t> The anonymity set is the set of all possible subjects and  may vary over time. The set of possible subjects
        depends on the knowledge of the attacker. Thus, anonymity is relative with respect to the
        attacker. Therefore, an initiator may be anonymous (initiator anonymity) only within a set of
        potential initiators, his/her initiator anonymity set, which itself may be a subset of all
        subjects who may send a message. The same for the responder
        means that a responder may be anonymous (responder anonymity) only within a set of potential
        responders, his/her responser anonymity set. Both anonymity sets
        may be disjoint, be the same, or they may overlap. 
      </t>
      
       <t>
        <list style="empty">
          <t>As an example consider RFC 3325 (P-Asserted-Identity) <xref target="RFC3325"/>, an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), that allows subjects, e.g. a voice over IP caller, to instruct a trusted intermediary not to populate the SIP From header field based on the authenticated and verified identity of the caller. The receipient of the call, as well as any other entity outside the trust domain with which the user authenticated would therefore only learn that the SIP message (typically a SIP INVITE) was sent with a header field 'From: "Anonymous" &lt;sip:anonymous@anonymous.invalid&gt;' (unless further information can be inferred from the other SIP protocol payloads) rather than the subject's real name or the subject's pseudonym (depending on the configuration).</t>

           <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Definition:"> Unlinkability of two or more items of interest (IOIs, e.g.,
            subjects, messages, actions, ...) from an attacker's perspective means that within the
            system (comprising these and possibly other items), the attacker cannot sufficiently
            distinguish whether these IOIs are related or not.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>Please note that
        unlinkability of two (or more) messages of course may depend on whether their content is
        protected against the attacker considered. In particular, messages may be unlinkable if we
        assume that the attacker is not able to get information on the initiator or responder from the
        message content. Yet with access to their content even without
        deep semantical analysis the attacker can notice certain characteristics which link them
        together, e.g., similarities in structure, style, use of some words or phrases, consistent
        appearance of some grammatical errors, etc.
      </t>
      
     <t>
      The unlinkability property can be considered as a more "fine-grained" version of anonymity 
      since there are many more relations where unlinkability might be an issue than just the relation
      "anonymity" between subjects and IOIs. Therefore, the attacker might get to know information 
      on linkability while not necessarily reducing anonymity of the particular subject. An 
      example might be that the attacker, in spite of being able to link all encrypted messages in a 
      transactions, does not learn who is doing this transaction. 
      </t>
     
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
      <t hangText="Definition:">We use the term "profiling" to mean learning information about an anonymous subject's activities without necessarily linking them to any specific transaction. For example, if an attacker concludes that a subject 
      plays a specific computer game, reads specific news article on a website, and uploads videos, then the subjects activities have been profiled, even if the attacker is unable to identify a specific subject.</t>
 </list>
      </t>

     <t>Sometimes it is necessary to make it explicit what attributes anonymity refers to (beyond the 
     subject to IOI relationship). For example, it may be useful to highlight that there is anonymity of the initiator in the sense that no message can be linked to this initiator.
     </t>
     
     <t>Relationship anonymity of a pair of subjects, means that sender and recipient (or each
        recipient in case of multicast) are unlinkable. The classical MIX-net <xref target="Chau81"/> 
        without dummy traffic is one implementation with just this property: The attacker sees who 
        sends messages when and who receives messages when, but cannot figure out who sends messages 
        to whom.

      title="Known Mechanisms for Anonymity, Undetectability, and Unobservability">

      <t>Before it makes sense to speak about any particular mechanisms for anonymity,
        undetectability, and unobservability in communications, let us first remark that all of them
        assume that stations of users do not emit signals the attacker considered is able to use for
        identification of stations or their behavior or even for identification of users or their
        behavior. So if you travel around taking with you a mobile phone sending more or less
        continuously signals to update its location information within a cellular radio network,
        don't be surprised if you are tracked using its signals. If you use a computer emitting lots
        of radiation due to a lack of shielding, don't be surprised if observers using high-tech
        equipment know quite a bit about what's happening within your machine. If you use a
        computer, PDA, or smartphone without sophisticated access control, don't be surprised if
        Trojan horses send your secrets to anybody interested whenever you are online - or via
        electromagnetic emanations even if you think you are completely offline.</t>

      <t>DC-net <xref target="Chau85"/>, <xref target="Chau88"/>, and MIX-net <xref target="Chau81"
        /> are mechanisms to achieve sender anonymity and relationship anonymity, respectively, both
        against strong attackers. If we add dummy traffic, both provide for the corresponding
        unobservability <xref target="PfPW91"/>. If dummy traffic is used to pad sending and/or
        receiving on the sender's and/or recipient's line to a constant rate traffic, MIX-nets can
        even provide sender and/or recipient anonymity and unobservability. </t>

      <t>Broadcast <xref target="Chau85"/>, <xref target="PfWa86"/>, <xref target="Waid90"/> and
        private information retrieval <xref target="CoBi95"/> are mechanisms to achieve recipient
        anonymity against strong attackers. If we add dummy traffic, both provide for recipient
        unobservability.</t>
      <t> This may be summarized: A mechanism to achieve some kind of anonymity appropriately
        combined with dummy traffic yields the corresponding kind of unobservability.</t>
      <t> Of course, dummy traffic alone can be used to make the number and/or length of sent
        messages undetectable by everybody except for the recipients; respectively, dummy traffic
        can be used to make the number and/or length of received messages undetectable by everybody
        except for the senders. (Note: Misinformation and disinformation may be regarded as semantic
        dummy traffic, i.e., communication from which an attacker cannot decide which are real
        requests with real data or which are fake ones. Assuming the authenticity of misinformation
        or disinformation may lead to privacy problems for (innocent) bystanders.) </t>
      <t>As a side remark, we mention steganography and spread spectrum as two other well-known
        undetectability mechanisms.</t>
      <t> The usual concept to achieve undetectability of IOIs at some layer, e.g., sending
        meaningful messages, is to achieve statistical independence of all discernible phenomena at
        some lower implementation layer. An example is sending dummy messages at some lower layer to
        achieve, e.g., a constant rate flow of messages looking - by means of encryption - randomly
        for all parties except the sender and the recipient(s). </t>

    <section anchor="pseudonymity" title="Pseudonymity">

      <t>Having anonymity of human beings, unlinkability, and maybe unobservability is superb w.r.t.
        data minimization, but would prevent any useful two-way communication. For many
        applications, we need appropriate kinds of identifiers. These identifiers are then used to refer 
        to established state or are used for access control purposes. An identifier is defined in 
        <xref target="id"/> as "a lexical token that names entities".</t>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Definition:">A pseudonym is an identifier of a subject other than one of the
            subject's real names.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>The term 'real name' is the antonym to "pseudonym". There may be multiple real names
            over lifetime, in particular the legal names, i.e., for a human being the names which
            appear on the birth certificate or on other official identity documents issued by the
            State; for a legal person the name under which it operates and which is registered in
            official registers (e.g., commercial register or register of associations). A human
            being's real name typically comprises their given name and a family name. Note that
            from a mere technological perspective it cannot always be determined whether an
            identifier of a subject is a pseudonym or a real name.
      </t>

      <t>Additional useful terms are:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Definition:"> The subject which the pseudonym refers to is the holder of the
              pseudonym.<vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

          <t hangText="Definition:">Pseudonymity is the use of pseudonyms as identifiers.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

        <t>So sender pseudonymity is defined as the sender being pseudonymous, recipient pseudonymity
        is defined as the recipient being pseudonymous.</t>

        <t>In order to be useful in the context of Internet communication we use the term digital pseudonym
        and declare it as a pseudonym that is suitable to be used to authenticate the holder's IOIs.</t>

      <t>Anonymity is the stronger, ... <list style="symbols">
          <t> the less personal data of the pseudonym holder can be linked to the pseudonym;</t>
          <t> the less often and the less context-spanning pseudonyms are used and therefore the
            less data about the holder can be linked;</t>
          <t> the more often independently chosen, i.e., from an observer's perspective unlinkable,
            pseudonyms are used for new actions.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>For Internet protocols it is important what the lifetime of the pseudonyms is, to whom they get exposed to, 
      how subjects are able to influence disclosure, and how often 
      they can be changed over time. </t>

    <section anchor="known-other" title="Known mechanisms and other properties of pseudonyms">
      <t>A digital pseudonym could be realized as a public key to test digital signatures where the
        holder of the pseudonym can prove holdership by forming a digital signature which is created
        using the corresponding private key <xref target="Chau81"/>. The most prominent example for
        digital pseudonyms are public keys generated by the user himself/herself, e.g., using PGP.
        In using PGP, each user may create an unlimited number of key pairs by himself/herself (at
        this moment, such a key pair is an initially unlinked pseudonym), bind each of them to an
        e-mail address, self-certify each public key by using his/her digital signature or asking
        another introducer to do so, and circulate it.</t>

      <t>A public key certificate bears a digital signature of a so-called certification authority
        and provides some assurance to the binding of a public key to another pseudonym, usually
        held by the same subject. In case that pseudonym is the civil identity (the real name) of a
        subject, such a certificate is called an identity certificate. An attribute certificate is a
        digital certificate which contains further information (attribute values) and clearly refers
        to a specific public key certificate. Independent of certificates, attributes may be used as
        identifiers of sets of subjects as well. Normally, attributes refer to sets of subjects
        (i.e., the anonymity set), not to one specific subject.</t>

      <t>There are several other properties of pseudonyms related to their use, such as revocation, 
         lifetime of the pseudonym, non-transferability, frequency of pseudonym changeover, the 
         ability to reveal civil identities in case of abuse, etc. Some of the properties may require 
         extension of the digital pseudonym by attributes of some kind. The binding of attributes to 
         a pseudonym can be documented in an attribute certificate produced either by the holder 
         himself/herself or by a certification authority.
