        <abstract>
		 <t>Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshakes often include fairly 
		 static information, such as the server
   certificate and a list of trusted certification authorities (CAs).
   This information can be of considerable size, particularly if the server
   certificate is bundled with a complete certificate chain 
   (i.e., the certificates of intermediate CAs up to the root CA).</t>
   
   <t>This document defines an extension that allows a TLS client to inform a server of cached information, 
   allowing the server to omit already available information.</t>
        </abstract>

    </front>

        <section title="Introduction">

   <t>Reducing the amount of information exchanged during a Transport Layer Security handshake to a minimum helps to 
   improve performance in environments where devices are connected to a 
   network with a low bandwidth, and lossy radio technology. 
   With Internet of Things such environments exist, for example, when devices
   use IEEE 802.15.4 or Bluetooth Smart. For more information 
   about the challenges with smart object deployments please see 
   <xref target="RFC6574"/>.</t>

   <t>This specification defines a TLS extension that allows a client and a 
   server to exclude transmission information cached in an earlier TLS handshake.
   </t>
   
   <t>A typical example exchange may therefore look as follows. First, the client and the server executes the full TLS handshake. The client then caches the certificate provided by the server. When the TLS client connects to the TLS server some time in the future, without using session resumption, it then attaches the cached_info extension defined in this document to the client hello message to indicate that it had cached the certificate, and it provides the fingerprint of it. If the server's certificate has not changed then the TLS server does not need to send its' certificate and the corresponding certificate chain again. In case information has changed, which can be seen from the fingerprint provided by the client, the certificate payload is transmitted to the client to allow the client to update the cache.</t>

<t>This document defines the following types: 
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Omitting the Server Certificate Message:"><vspace blankLines="1"/> 
With the type field set to 'cert', the client MUST include the message digest of the Certificate message in the hash_value field. For this type the message digest MUST be calculated using SHA-256 <xref target="RFC4634"/>.</t>
<t hangText="Omitting the CertificateRequest Message"><vspace blankLines="1"/>

<t>New types can be added following the policy described in the IANA considerations section, see <xref target="IANA"/>. Different message digest algorithms for use with these types can also be added by registering a new type that makes use of this updated message digest algorithm.</t>

<section title="Exchange Specification">

<t>Clients supporting this extension MAY include the "cached_info" extension in the (extended) client hello. If the client includes the extension then it MUST contain one or more CachedObject attributes.</t>

<t>A server supporting this extension MAY include the "cached_info" extension in the (extended) server hello. By returning the "cached_info" extension the server indicates that it supports the cached info types. For each indicated cached info type the server MUST alter the transmission of respective payloads, according to the rules outlined with each type. If the server includes the extension it MUST only include CachedObjects of a type also supported by the client (as expressed in the client hello). For example, if a client indicates support for 'cert' and 'cert_req' then the server cannot respond with a "cached_info" attribute containing support for 'cert_status'.</t>

<t>Since the client includes a fingerprint of information it cached (for each indicated type) the server is able to determine whether cached information is stale. If the server supports this specification and notices a mismatch between the data cached by the client and its own information then the server MUST include the information in full and MUST NOT list the respective type in the "cached_info" extension.</t>

<t>Note: If a server is part of a hosting environment then the client may have cached multiple data items for a single server. To allow the client to select the appropriate information from the cache it is RECOMMENDED that the client utilizes the Server Name Indication extension <xref target="RFC6066"/>.</t>

<t>Following a successful exchange of the "cached_info" extension in the client and server hello,
   the server alters sending the corresponding handshake message. How information is altered from the handshake messages is defined in <xref target="cert"/>, and in <xref target="cert_req"/> for the types defined in this specification.</t>


<section anchor="cert" title="Server Certificate Message">

<t>When a ClientHello message contains the "cached_info" extension with a type set to 'cert' then the server MAY send the Certificate message shown in <xref target="cert-structure-modified"/> under the following conditions:

<list style="enumerate">
<t>The server software implements the "cached_info" extension defined in this specification.</t>
<t>The 'cert' cached info extension is enabled (for example, a policy allows the use of this extension).</t>
<t>The server compared the value in the hash_value field of the client-provided "cached_info" extension with the fingerprint of the Certificate message it normally sends to clients. This check ensures that the information cached by the client is current.</t>

<t>The original Certificate handshake message syntax is defined in RFC 5246 <xref target="RFC5246"/> and has the structure shown in <xref target="cert-structure"/>.</t>

<t>The fingerprint MUST be computed as follows: hash_value:=SHA-256(Certificate)</t>

 <t>Note that RFC 7250 <xref target="RFC7250"/> allows the certificate payload to contain only the SubjectPublicKeyInfo instead of the full information typically found in a certificate. Hence, when this specification is used in combination with <xref target="RFC7250"/> and the negotiated certificate type is a raw public key then the TLS server omits sending a Certificate payload that contains an ASN.1 Certificate structure with the included SubjectPublicKeyInfo rather than the full certificate. As such, this extension is compatible with the raw public key extension defined in RFC 7250.</t>

        <section title="Example">

<t><xref target="example"/> illustrates an example exchange using the TLS cached info extension. 
In the normal TLS handshake exchange shown in flow (A) the TLS server provides its certificate 
in the Certificate payload to the client, see step [1]. This allows the client to store the certificate 
for future use. After some time the TLS client again interacts with the same TLS server and makes use of the
TLS cached info extension, as shown in flow (B). The TLS client indicates support for this specification 
via the "cached_info" extension, see [2], and indicates that it has stored the certificate from the earlier 
exchange (by indicating the 'cert' type). With [3] the TLS server acknowledges the supports of the 'cert' type and by including the value in the server hello informs the client that the content of the certificate payload contains the fingerprint of the certificate instead of the RFC 5246-defined payload of the certificate message in message [4].</t>

        <section title="Security Considerations">

            <t>This specification defines a mechanism to reference stored state using a fingerprint.
		Sending a fingerprint of cached information in an
   unencrypted handshake, as the client and server hello is, may allow an attacker or observer to 
   correlate independent TLS exchanges. While some information elements used in this specification,
   such as server certificates, are public objects and usually do not contain 
   sensitive information, other (not yet defined cached info types) may. Those who implement and deploy this specification should therefore 
   make an informed decision whether the cached information is inline with their security and privacy goals. 
   In case of concerns, it is advised to avoid sending the fingerprint of the data objects in clear.</t>

   <t>The use of the cached info extension allows the server to obmit sending certain TLS messages. Consequently, these omitted messages are not included in the transcript of the handshake in the TLS Finish message per value. However, since the client communicates the hash values of the cached values in the initial handshake message the fingerprints are included in the TLS Finish message. </t>

<t>Clients MUST ensure that they only cache information from legitimate sources. For example, when the client populates the cache from a TLS exchange then it must only cache information after the successful completion of a TLS exchange to ensure that an attacker does not inject incorrect information into the cache. Failure to do so allows for man-in-the-middle attacks.</t>
