Both cases lead to fraudulent issue of certificates and raise questions regarding the strength of the WebPKI used by so many applications.</t>	  <t>Almost 2 years have passed since these incidents and various standardization activities have happened in the meanwhile offering new technical solutions to make the public key infrastructure more resilient.</t>      <t>The important question, however, is which of the technical solutions will get widespread deployment? In this document we compare the different technical solutions in an attempt to engage the impacted stakeholders to trigger deployment actions to improve the status quo. This document does not include any recommendations what techniques to use.</t>    </abstract>  </front>  <middle>    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">      <t>High-profile data breaches and security incidents on the Web are gaining increasing attention from the public, the press, and governments. A few examples may illustrate the problems: DigiNotar, a Dutch certificate authority, had a security breach <xref target="DigiNotar"/> and in the same year a Comodo affiliate was compromised <xref target="Comodo"/>. Both cases lead to fraudulent issue of certificates.</t>      <t>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) makes use of a trusted third party, the certificate authority (CA), to bind the subject name to a public key. A CA may, however, get compromised despite the best security practices and operational procedures. The main problem, however, is that any CA can issue a certificate for any domain name. One compromised CA is therefore able to impact the security of the entire public key infrastructure. In the case of DigiNotar the attacker was able to issue certificates for Google services even though Google never made use of services from DigiNotar and might not have ever heard of that CA before.</t>      <t>Furthermore, over time browsers and applications increased the number of trust anchors that are shipped pre-installed. Depending on software the number of trust anchors may exceed 600, as reported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) in their SSL Observatory study <xref target="SSL-Observatory"/>. While the larger number provides choice for relying parties regarding the CA they can select for obtaining a certificate there is also a downside: with today's WebPKI set-up it is sufficient to compromise a single CA to impact the security for all relying parties. Many users and researchers were surprised about the large number of trust anchors installed in normal operating systems and browsers without having an easy way to adjust that list to their preferences.</t>	  <t>These developments have led to a number of standardization activities in response to these developments. In this document we briefly summarize the available technical solutions and include an assessment about who needs to make changes, what type of benefits are provided, and what dependencies exist. The investigated solutions include DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/>, Certificate Transparency <xref target="RFC6962"/>, Public Key Pinning 	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-websec-key-pinning"/>, TACK <xref target="I-D.perrin-tls-tack"/>, ... [what else? Perspectives, Sovereign Keys, Mecai, Convergence, DetecTor ].</t> 	  	  <t>While there are other challenges with security on the Web, such as user interface problems with certificate warnings, insecure use of cookies, cross-site scripting attacks, injection attacks, etc., this document focuses on improving the public key infrastructure only. It is also worth reminding ourselves that the Web public key infrastructure is not only used for Web applications but also for a range of other applications, including smart phone apps. Furthermore, other public key infrastructures that operate under a different regime with different policies may suffer from similar problems. Consequently, the solution techniques discussed in this document are also useful for these other PKI deployments.</t>	  	  <t>The main purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the technical solutions. This description will help us to develop a roadmap for the deployment of the best solutions to improve the overall security of the public key infrastructure.</t>	  	  <t>Final note: There are also process solutions, such as stricter audits of CAs with the aim to improve operational practices, and these are not described in this document. These measures will be useful in addition to the technical solutions described in this document. Alone they will, however, not address the underlying problem.</t>	</section> 		<section anchor="terms" title="Terminology">		<t>This document uses the following terms from from RFC 3280 <xref target="RFC3280"/>:	<list style="hanging">	   <t hangText="end entity:"> user of PKI certificates and/or end user system that is               the subject of a certificate.</t>	   <t hangText="CA:">certification authority</t>	   </list> 	</t>	</section> 		<section anchor="solutions" title="Technical Solutions">	  	  <section title="DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)">	    <t>DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/> offers the option to use the DNS infrastructure to store certificates. DANE is envisioned as a preferable basis for binding public keys to DNS names, because the entities that vouch for the binding of public key data to DNS names are the same entities responsible for managing the DNS names in question.</t>      <t>Distributing certificates via the DNS does, however, require DNSSEC. With the help of DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"/><xref target="RFC4034"/><xref target="RFC4035"/> this offers an opportunity to eliminate off-line processes for validation of the subject name, which today often requires sending a mail to the administrator of that domain. This relationship can be easily demonstrated by having the zone administrator for the subject domain post the public key in the DNS and digitally sign the resulting zone.</t>   <t>A high-level description about the different options offered by DANE can be found in <xref target="IETF-Journal-DANE"/> and the authoritative version can be found in RFC 6698 <xref target="RFC6698"/>.</t>   	  </section> 	  	  <section title="Certificate Transparency"> 	    <t>RFC 6962 <xref target="RFC6962"/> specifies Certificate Transparency, a protocol for publicly logging the existence of certificates as they are issued or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit   certificate authority (CA) activity and notice the issuance of suspect certificates as well as to audit the certificate logs themselves.  The intent is that eventually clients would refuse to honor certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively forcing CAs to add all issued certificates to the logs.</t>	   <t>The publicly auditable, append-only logs of all issued certificates does not prevent misissue but allows    interested parties to detect misissuance.</t>   <t>While various projects, including the EFF with their SSL Observatory <xref target="SSL-Observatory"/>, have scanned the Internet to collect all certificates of TLS servers to complete (in presence of IPv6, which makes scanning the Internet much more difficult and the deployment of the TLS Server Name Indication <xref target="RFC6066"/>) the cooperation from all CAs of from certificate owners is required.</t>      <t>The expected operation is as follows: CAs or certificate owners contact logs and upload certificates, as they issue them. In response, they receive a Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT). The SCT is the log's promise to incorporate the certificate in the Merkle Tree, which is the data structure used by the log, within a fixed amount of time. Everyone can check the log for consistency. Particularly website operators will  have an interest to regularly check the logs for misissuance of certificates. TLS clients on the other hand are not expected to directly communicate with logs to avoid the communication overhead. Instead, the TLS servers provides the SCT along with the certificate within the TLS handshake. TLS clients reject certificates that do not have a valid SCT for the end entity certificate. Since there is ideally more than one log TLS servers need to provide SCTs from multiple logs to the client.</t>   <t>This document has gone through a public review process, and has been approved by the Internet Engineering Steering Group and published an experimental RFC.</t>	  </section> 	  	  <section anchor="key-pinning" title="Public Key Pinning for HTTP">	    <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-websec-key-pinning"/> describes a solution for instruct user agents (UAs) to remember ("pin") certificates (end entity certificates or CA certs) for a given period of time.  During that time, UAs will require that the host present a certificate chain including at least one Subject Public Key Info structure whose fingerprint matches one of the pinned fingerprints for that host.</t>				<t>While the specification provides a number of instructions for the Website operator to indicate towards the UA the basic operation is rather simple and assumes a trust-on-first-use policy. To deal with the change of certificates or other failure scenarios the concept of a backup pin is utilized.  A Backup Pin is a fingerprint for the public key of a secondary, not-yet-deployed key pair.  The operator keeps the backup key pair offline, and sets a pin for it in the Public-Key-Pins header.  Then, in case the operator loses control of their   primary private key, they can deploy the backup key pair. An interesting feature of the specification is to report pin validation failure.</t>           <t>When a pin validation failure occurs the expectation is that the user is notified about the inconsistency (with optionally reporting taking place in the background).</t> 				<t>This document is the product of the IETF Web Security working group.</t>	  </section> 	  	  <section title="Trust Assertions for Certificate Keys (TACK)">	  	  <t>Similarly to the key pinning solution described in <xref target="key-pinning"/> TACK <xref target="I-D.perrin-tls-tack"/> also aims to enables a TLS server to support "pinning" to a self-chosen signing key. There are, however, a number of substantial differences in the design despite the similarity of the name.</t>      <t>TLS server operators create a so-called "TACK signing key" (TSK) and sign their own keys used by TLS servers. A TACK pin then associates a hostname, a TSK, and various parameters (including pin creating time, and lifetime of the pin). A TLS server operator may change a key for a server at any point in time since the TSK will be unchanged. The existing public key infrastructure is replaced by a form of self-signed certificates. Clients store the TACK pins in their pin stores, which they may have obtained from different sources. Although the focus of the specification is to obtain the TACK pins via a TLS extension from the server directly a mechanism to obtain these TACK pins from a third party infrastructure is envisioned, although outside the scope of the specification. When TACK pins are obtained from the TLS server directly they follow a trust-on-first-use approach; a third party distribution mechanism may have additional security properties.</t>      <t>For incremental deployment the TLS client uses the extension mechanism of TLS to indicate support for the TACK extension by including a new TLS extension type in the ClientHello message. A TLS server that does not support TACK will reply with an ordinary certificate. In case the TLS server supports the extension it replies with the newly defined tack structure, which contains the TACK pin for that server.</t>      <t>This specification is an individual submission to the IETF.</t>	     <t>[Editor's Note: The document says in some places that the proposal also works with certificates but I fail to see the details since the TLS server key is signed with the TSK.]</t>	  </section> 	  	  <section title="Perspectives">	  	  <t>Perspectives <xref target="Perspectives"/> aims to utilize notaries (i.e., public servers) that monitor and record the history of public keys used by sites. While the description focuses on the use of raw public keys (in the style of SSH) the same concept also works with certificates.</t>	  	  <t>The basic approach is simple: When a TLS client starts to interact with a TLS server it is presented with a key/certificate that it had not seen before. To verify that the key/certificate is the same as observed by other vantage points in the network it contacts one or multiple notary servers. These notary servers provide key/certificate information they have obtained about the specific website earlier.</t>      <t>To improve the leap of faith security by clients the notary services adds security value since they may have obtained the key/certificate from the website in the past already and from a different vantage points in terms of the path used to talk to the server. This helps when attacks are temporary and when the attacker is located somewhere along the path between the client and the server. The use of multiple notaries also helps to detect malicious notaries.</t>	  	  <t>With clients caching information about the keys/certificates of sites visited earlier and the information obtained from notaries there is no additional protocol overhead. In this respect the solution works similar to key pinning. The additional communication overhead for the client only occurs at the time when the client talks to a server for the first time or when the cached information expires.</t>	  	  <t>Similar to other notary services there is the question about how they obtain information about the available TLS servers. For popular services obtaining the keys/certificates a list of sites is assumed to pre-configured and queried periodically but for the long tail of small websites the suggested approach query these sites the first time the client wants to connect to them.</t> 	  	  <t>The proposal is documented in form of an academic research paper - no specification is available.</t>	  </section> 	  	  <section title="Mutually Endorsing CA Infrastructure (MECAI)">	  	  <t>MECAI <xref target="MECAI"/> builds conceptually on top of the Perspective proposal. Perspectives introduces notaries, as new entities in the public key infrastructure, and MECAI takes the position that this function can be taken by existing CAs. With this new role they would turn into Voucher Authorities (VAs), who issue vouchers that confirm what they observe. A voucher is a signature computed over a number of fields including the hash of the server certificate, the certificate chain, the IP address of the server, revocation status information, etc. Of course, a voucher would be created by a CA other than the one that created the original certificate.</t>	  	  <t>A client would therefore perform the following steps: it connects to a server via TLS and the server provides the certificate. Then, the client needs to obtain one or multiple vouchers for the server certificate. This can happen either inband within the TLS handshake when talking to the server, similarly to how OCSP stapling works, or via a separate protocol exchange. The former approach is less expensive in terms of communication costs for the client. In any case, a voucher request protocol is needed to let entities (like TLS servers) talk to VAs to obtain a voucher.</t>	  	  <t>A client or a server can detect misissuance by matching the information in the vouchers with the certificate.</t>	  	  <t>Only a high-level description is available via <xref target="MECAI"/> but no detailed technical specification.</t>	  </section>	  	  <!-- 	  	  <section title="DetecTor">	  	   <t>MECAI <xref target="MECAI"/>	  	  </section> 	  --> 	  	</section> 	  	  	      <section anchor="comparison" title="Comparison">      <t>TBD: This section compares the different proposals</t>    </section>	  	      <section anchor="limitations" title="Limitations">      <t>TBD: This section describes limitations that are common to all proposals. 	  Examples include enterprise firewalls, hotspots with captive portals, user interface challenges</t>    </section>	    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">      <t>This entire document is about security.</t>    </section>	    <section anchor="privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">      <t>The main privacy threat is correlation.
