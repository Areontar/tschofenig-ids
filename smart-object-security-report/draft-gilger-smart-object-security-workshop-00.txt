Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop          August 2012


1.  Introduction

   In early 2011, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) solicited
   position statements for a workshop on 'Interconnecting Smart Objects
   with the Internet' [RFC6574] , aiming to get feedback from the wider
   Internet community on their experience with deploying IETF protocols
   in constrained environments.  The workshop took place in Prague on
   March, 25th, 2011.  During the workshop, a range of topics were
   discussed, including architecture, routing, energy efficiency, and
   security.  The workshop report summarizes the discussion and
   suggested several next steps.

   During the months following the workshop a number of IETF initiatives
   were started, IETF participants submitted Internet drafts, and
   hands-on coding events were organized at IETF#80 and IETF#81 to
   better facilitate the exchange of ideas.

   With the contributions on security in the IETF CoRE working group as
   well as in the IETF TLS working group it became clear that further
   discussions on security were necessary and that those would have to
   feed in implementation and deployment experience as well as a shared
   understanding how various building blocks fit into a larger
   architecture.

   The workshop on Smart Object Security was organized to bring together
   various disconnected discussions about smart object security happing
   in different IETF working groups and industry fora.  It was a one-day
   workshop, held prior to the IETF 83 in Paris on March 23, 2012.

   The workshop organizers were particularly interested to get input on
   the following topics, as outlined in the call for position papers:

   o  What techniques for issuing credentials have been deployed?

   o  What extensions are useful to make existing security protocols
      more suitable for smart objects?

   o  What type of credentials are frequently used?

   o  What experience has been gained when implementing and deploying
      application layer, transport layer, network layer, and link layer
      security mechanisms (or a mixture of all of them)?

   o  How can "clever" implementations make security protocols a better
      fit for constrained devices?

   o  Are there lessons we can learn from existing deployments?

3.  Workshop Structure

   With 36 accepted position papers there was a wealth of topics to talk
   about during the one-day workshop.  The program committee decided to
   divide the discussion into four topic areas with two or three invited
   talks per slot to get a discussion started.  This section will
   summarize the points raised by the invited speakers as well as the
   essence of the ensuing discussions.

3.1.  Requirements and Use Cases

   The first slot concerned itself with the requirements of security in
   smart object networks.  To design a security solution an initial
   starting point is to understand the communication relationships, the
   constraints, and the security threats.  To approach security from
   this angle is also common in the IETF, as documented in [RFC3552] and
   in [RFC4101] .

   The first talk was by Paul Chilton, who demonstrated the security and
   usability requirements in a typical end-user scenario, namely for
   small-scale smart lighting systems.  These systems present a
   substantial challenge for providing usable and secure communication
   because they are supposed to be cheap and very easy to set up,
   ideally as easy as their "dumb" predecessors.

   Rudolf van der Berg talked about his work in government and industry
   with regard to legislature concerning cell networks run not only by
   cell service providers but also other large companies.  The main
   argument of his talk was about allowing other companies to become
   mobile operators to be able to efficiently deploy large-scale M2M
   networks.

   The main messages of the discussion in this slot can be summarized as
   follows:

   o  In the consumer market, security should not incur any overhead
      during installation.  If a user has to invest more time or effort
      to secure a smart object network, he or she will likely not do it.
      Consumer products will often be retrofitted into the existing
      infrastructure, bought and installed by consumers themselves.
      This means that devices will have to come pre-installed to some
      extent and will most likely interoperate only with the
      infrastructure provided by the vendor, i.e., the devices will be
      able to connect to the Internet but will only interoperate with
      the servers provided by the vendor selling the device.

   o  One important question for systems is whether security will be
      terminated at the border router (or proxy) at the customer's

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop          August 2012


      premise or if end-to-end security to servers in the Internet is
      required.  A more detailed discussion can be found at discussed in
      [I-D.tschofenig-smart-object-architecture] .

   o  Once security threats for a specific usage and deployment scenario
      have been identified an assessment takes place to decide what
      security requirements can be identified and what security
      properties are desirable for the solution.  As part of this
      process a concious decision needs to take place what
      countermeasures will be used to mitigate certain threats.  For
      certain security threats the assessment may also lead to the
      conclusion that the threat is considered out-of-scope and
      therefore no technical protection is applied.  Different
      businesses are likely to come to different conclusions about the
      priorties for protection and what security requirements will be
      derived.  The discussion among the workshop participants reflected
      the challenge what security threats are worthwhile to protect
      against.  For some of the workshop participants the security
      threats against a smart lighting system were considered relative
      minor compared to other smart home applicances.  Clearly, the
      threats depend on the specific application domain but there is a
      certain danger that the systems which we will have initially will
      not be as sensitive in terms of security.  But, as the systems
      evolve and become more pervasive additional security features may
      be required and may be difficult to incorporate into the already
      installed base.  Experience shows security breaches that are
      considered to be a prank usually move very rapidly to become
      destructive attacks.

   o  Apart from the security requirements of individual households and
      users, it is also important to look at the large-scale
      implications of possible vulnerabilities, for example for the
      power grid.  Smart object networks will see the same technology
      deployed in consumer networks as well as in million-device
      networks with service schedules of five to fifteen years.

   o  The example of IP-enabled lightbulbs immediately shows that the
      more constrained devices are, the more difficult it is to get
      security right.  For this reason, and the required usability,
      lightbulbs might just be the perfect example for examining the
      viability of security solutions.

   o  Closed systems (one bulb, one switch) often work, as they can be
      factory-configured.  Problems do arise when we want to add
      additional devices into an existing system.  It is not acceptable
      that a device is in a vulnerable, but Internet-connected, state
      before it has been correctly configured by a consumer.  It is easy
      to conceive that many consumers do not configure their devices

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop          August 2012


      properly and may therefore make it easy for an adversary to take
      control of the device by, for example, using the factor-default
      password settings.

   o  With security options on multiple layers, we have to think hard
      about where we actually need it.

   Summarizing the discussion, the following points could be made:

   o  We have a technology that will be both deployed by end-users and
      large-scale business users.  Between these two, the security
      requirements differ significantly, as do the threats.  It will
      always be impossible to develop a single security architecture.
      The requirements can come in various constraints for devices,
      involved stakeholders, needs to integrate the devices into
      existing networks or software platforms, threats that have to be
      taken serious, management capabilities, etc.

   o  The question remains whether we can expect smart objects to be as
      easily usable as the legacy devices they are supposed to replace.

   o  What became clear on the outset of the discussion was the big gap
      between deployment schemes for large-scale, industrial
      applications and end-users.  This would have a direct impact on
      the possible security that could be realised and would be a
      sensitive topic throughout the rest of the workshop.

   o  Problem Definition: We can identify five steps needed for most of
      the scenarios that came up in this workshop.

      *  Introduce devices to each other

      *  Secure the communication between those devices

      *  State participants allowed actions (authorization)

      *  Enforce these authorizations

      *  Implementation in many different classes of devices

   o  Additionally, there is the usual wealth of other requirements that
      need to be taken into account, such as ability for remote
      configuration and software updates, able to deal with transfer of
      ownership of a device, no operator or vendor lock-in, crypto
      agility, minimize cost, low license and IPR costs, etc.

3.2.  Implementation Experience

   The second slot during the workshop was dedicated to reports from
   first-hand implementation experiences the participants had with
   existing protocols and cryptographic primitives for smart object
   networks.

   There were three invited talks which covered tiny implementations of
   the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and DTLS (Carsten
   Bormann), TLS and Raw Public Keys (Hannes Tschofenig) as well as
   general experience when implementing public key cryptography on smart
   object devices (Mohit Sethi).

   All three presenters demonstrated that implementations of IETF
   security protocols are feasible.  The overall code size and
   performance will depend on the chosen features.  It is fairly obvious
   that more freatures translate to a more complex specification.
   Luckily, IETF security protocols (and DTLS/TlS is no exception) can
   be customized in a variety of ways.  As such a product developer will
   have to decide what features are important to them and what trade-
   offs can be made.

   o  Making security protocols suitable for smart objects must not
      water down their effectiveness.  The experience with implementing
      available security protocol has shown their suitability for smart
      objects.  We might also underestimate the ability of users to
      adapt to the new technologies.

   o  The workshop participants again reinforced the message that was
      made at earlier smart object workshop [RFC6574] regarding future
      developments in the smart object space, namely: "While there are
      constantly improvements being made, Moore's law tends to be less
      effective in the embedded system space than in personal computing
      devices: gains made available by increases in transistor count and
      density are more likely to be invested in reductions of cost and
      power requirements than into continual increases in computing
      power.".  Consequently, we will have to work with the current
      limitations of the different classes of smart objects.  A
      refinement of the different classes is currently work in progress
      in [I-D.ietf-lwig-guidance] .

   o  [TBD: Is this really something people believe is a problem?]  DTLS
      evolved over time.  Compared to the single roundtrip needed by
      CoAP, using DTLS with CoAP results in many more message exchanges.
      In reality, even more messages might be needed due to
      fragmentation, and these will likely not arrive in order.  If a
      packet is lost an entire protocol exchange may need to be re-
      transmitted. flight might have to be retransmitted.  Using CoAP to



Gilger & Tschofenig     Expires February 2, 2013                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop          August 2012


      actually transport DTLS might be a solution to the retransmission
      problem.  Finally, the DTLS state machine is still rather large
      for constrained devices.

   o  Since CoAP was designed for constrained devices while DTLS was
      not, it might be tempting to go and design a new security protocol
      tailored to the restrictions of smart objects.  However, that
      would run the risk of creating a weak protocol since it has not
      been analyzed as extensively as DTLS.  So the best approach would
      be to use DTLS but think about transporting (and implementing) it
      more efficiently.

   o  Consensus seems to be that the implementations presented during
      the workshop are "small enough" for a certain class of smart
      objects.  Even despite the seemingly complex protocols available
      today redesigning them might very likely lead to a similar outcome
      in terms of security and features.  It was, however, also
      acknowledged that the security properties offered by DTLS may not
      be needed for all protocol.  DTLS offers authentication and key
      exchange combined with channel security, which includes data-
      origin authentication, integrity protection, and (optionally)
      confidentiality protection.

   o  What is deciding for the code size of a deployed product are not
      necessarily the protocols being used but rather a lot of related
      decisions, like the number of communication partners, the
      communication model, the attack vectors.  These will ultimately
      drive the code size and thus cost.

   o  The question was raised whether the focus on code size in software
      is appropriate or whether we can expect future devices to
      implement a lot of the functionality in hardware, once a common
      architecture has been established.  Some participants argued that
      reducing energy consumption is the most important goal in the
      design of a smart object and memory, on the other hand is fairly
      easy (and cheap) to add.

   o  The three common constraints for security implementations on smart
      objects are code size, energy consumption, and bandwidth.  There
      is an open argument about the relation of number of bits
      transferred vs. the possible computations which could be performed
      with the same energy.  For symmetric cryptography, additional
      computation is certainly worth the effort.

   Since the presentations in this slot were built on hard facts, there
   was considerably less high-level discussion about the content,
   leading some participants to criticize the focus on small details.
   Some of the main messages of this slot:



Gilger & Tschofenig     Expires February 2, 2013               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop          August 2012


   o  Lots of protocols available and ready to use.  Also a large number
      of cryptographic algorithms are available.  All security protocols
      can be customized so that they can be tailored to the specific
      needs of a certain use case.

   o  Smart objects suffer from a number of constraints and the focus
      for optimization may vary from use case to use case.  Sometimes
      the constraint is energy consumption and in other cases it is
      memory, CPU performance, or bandwidth.  In any case, for an
      optimization it is important to look at the entire system rather
      than a single protocols or even certain algorithms.

   o  The numbers presented by the implementations on constrained
      devices (32bit and 8bit) are surprisingly small to many people in
      the audience.  The message is that code size of cryptography is
      nothing to worry about, and even the execution time for relatively
      expensive operations like asymmetric signature generation and
      verification are within acceptable limits.  In either case, public
      key cryptography will like only be used once for a security
      relationship, to bootstrap a symmetric shared secret.  The cost of
      transmitting data wirelessly dwarfs even expensive computations
      like public key cryptography.

   o  Scalability does not imply usability.  This means that while smart
      object technology might currently be developed in large scale
      industrial scopes, it should be equally usable for consumers who
      want to equip their home with just a few lightbulbs.

   o  In summary, the cryptographic primitives work well enough for
      smart object scenarios and do not need further optimization.  The
      security protocols and data formats however are not that well
      suited yet and might need refinement.

   o  We have to look at code size in terms of a whole system, including
      the cryptography, the protocols (and their state machine) and
      additional parts such as provisioning, all of which have to work
      together.  When we are able to evaluate the code size of a
      complete system, we also have to look at energy consumption in
      terms of computation and data transmission and reception.

   o  Since wireless reception is actually the most power consuming task
      on a smart object, we have to design our protocols accordingly.

   o  We have not yet looked at cross-layer aspects (of security)
      enough.  We also need to think about how many protocols for
      security setup we want to have.  One per layer?  Wireless security
      is something where there often is duplication across layers.

3.3.  Authorization and Role-based Access Control

   The discussion slot on authorization was meant to provide an idea of
   what kind of authorization decisions are common in smart object
   networks.  As definded in [RFC4949] authorization is defined as 'an
   approval that is granted to a system entity to access a system
   resource'.

   Since smart objects may be limited in terms of code size, persistent
   storage, and Internet connectivity a number of established
   authorization schemes are not very well suited for such devices.
   Obviously, delegating every authorization decision to another node in
   the network incurs a certain network overhead, while storing
   sophisticated access control policies directly on the smart object
   might be prohibitive because of the size of such a ruleset.

   There were two invited talks in this slot.  The first talk (Richard
   Barnes) looked past communication security and made the argument that
   problems such as identity, imprinting and authentication were only
   the beginning of securing smart object networks.  The second talk
   (Jan Janak) presented one approach to distributing access control
   policies to smart objects within one administrative domain.

   Some of the points raised during the discussion in this slot:

   o  We have to ask why we actually want security and what this
      security is supposed to do in our smart object network.  Richard
      Barnes argued that we do crypto because we want to control who can
      do what with data and services.  As examples, the decisions can
      range from 'only devices with password can use the network' to
      very detailed application specification authorization decisions.

   o  In those cases where access control decisions are bound to the
      identifiers of devices and humans need to either create or verify
      these access control policies the choice of identifier matters for
      readability and accessibility purposes.

   o  The model that dominates the web will not be enough.  Simply
      identifying users by their credentials and servers via
      certificates is not something that translates to smart object
      networks, because it binds all the capabilities to the
      credentials.  The evolution in access control is moving in the
      direction of granting third parties certain capabilities, with
      OAuth being an example of a currently deployed technology.

   o  Beyond the case of one-to-one imprinting, how do devices identify
      to each other?  Who will create the access control policies and
      how will this policy be distributed?  Where will authorization be

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop          August 2012


      enforced?

   o  We have to take care to differentiate between the term of identity
      and identifier, because identity has mostly been used for natural
      persons and as such, discussions about identity often include
      privacy concerns.

   o  It will be interesting on how the user interfaces for access
      control will look like.  How will devices be identified, how can
      average users grant permissions, what devices will be used for
      that task?

   o  In the discussion the idea of a manufacturer as the resource owner
      (i.e., of the smart object) and to have the smart object "phone
      home" when it is first switched on was raised.  The manufacturer
      can then delegate ownership to the customer who actually bought
      the device.  Proof of ownership could be done by identifying the
      user at the time of purchase, which is something that is
      increasingly being done today.  Another option is some kind of
      secret information enclosed in the packaging.

   o  With interface-constrained devices, decoupling user credentials
      from devices capabilities is even more important.

   o  Will there be third parties which have a business interest in
      providing something like key escrow over the lifetime of a smart
      object?  For constrained devices, will it always be possible to
      fall back to the existing security associations between device and
      manufacturer to create new associations?  Obviously, we do not
      want the lifetime of a smart object limited by the lifetime of the
      manufacturer.

   o  We should also think about other, implicit policy inputs, such as
      proximity, location or physical effort.

   o  The variety of authorization schemes shows that a single protocol
      (or indeed any number of protocols) will likely not help with
      solving the wide range of authorization tasks.  While we can look
      at different ways to do authorization internal to the system,
      there might not be the need to standardize any additional
      authorization mechanisms or authorization related protocols.  In
      fact many of the authentication and key exchange protocols have
      authorization mechanisms built-in.  These existing mechanisms,
      such as Kerberos, OAuth, EAP/AAA, and attribute certificates, can
      be re-used.

   Some of the main messages in this slot:




Gilger & Tschofenig     Expires February 2, 2013               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop          August 2012


   o  Authorization requires a view on the entire smart object lifecycle
      to determine when and how a device was added to a specific
      environment and what permissions have been granted for this device
      and how users are allowed to interact with it.  It was clear that
      the authorization decisions are likely to be more sophisticated
      with scenarios where ownership of devices may be transferred from
      one person to another one, group membership concepts may be
      needed, authorization decisions have to be revokable, granularity
      of group membership may be fine grained.

   o  It is important to separate authentication from authorization
      right from the beginning and to consider how users are supposed to
      interact with these devices to introduce them into their specific
      usage environment (and provision them with credentials), and to
      manage access from different parties.

   o  For authorization on smart objects, the most important questions
      seems to remain where an access policy will be enforced, as this
      will dictate the architecture of the system.  For consumer
      networks it will be equally important who will actually write
      these policies.  In most cases, the user interaction will happen
      using a webbrowser or a smartphone, rather than the actual smart
      objects.

   o  The OAuth protocol was mentioned as a good example of a protocol
      that separates the authentication from the authorization step.
      Access to a resource using OAuth can be done purely based on the
      capabilities rather than on the authenticated identity.  Further
      investigations need to be done to determine the suitability of
      OAuth as a protocol for the smart object environment as the
      current work focus is HTTP-based and the only other ongoing work
      looks into the integration of OAuth into SASL and the GSS-API,
      which has not been subject to extensive studies by the workshop
      participants either.

   o  Where will the identifiers for smart objects come from?

3.4.  Provisioning - 'Getting from nothing to something'

   When a smart object is to be introduced into a network, it usually
   has to be provisioned with some information about the network.  For
   some networks, an auto-discovery feature of the smart object might
   retrieve the necessary information, but this is not an option when
   there is some kind of access control by the network.  In this case,
   the smart object has to be provisioned with security parameters
   before it is able to join the network.  Furthermore, if the network
   wants to perform some kind of action using the smart object, it has
   to have the necessary credentials to do so.  The identity of the

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop          August 2012


   network (or a controller) has to be imprinted on the smart object.

   Imprinting and provisioning have a lot in common with so-called
   pairing protocols which usually establish a security association
   between two equal devices, such as Bluetooth-equipped cell phones.
   What is different is the lack of user interfaces on a typical smart
   object, as well as the difference in deployment scenario.  Where and
   how a smart object is to be paired with a network can differ
   substantially from consumer pairing scenarios.

   The last slot of the workshop was about provisioning and imprinting.
   While the other slots often touched protocols or very high-level
   discussions, this slot was concerned with the very practical question
   of how to get some kind of information on a smart object in the first
   place.

   There were two invited talks in this last discussion slot.  The first
   one (Johannes Gilger) dealt with the very basic ideas behind pairing
   schemes, including the kinds of out-of-band channels that could be
   employed and their limitations.  In the second talk, the speaker
   (Cullen Jennings) presented a deployment model for smart objects
   based on a model used for IP phones.

   Some of the points raised during the discussion in this slot:

   o  Current type of pairing schemes will not work for most smart
      objects.  The typical smart object device will not have many (or
      any) user interface, limiting the options of current schemes.  For
      large-scale deployments, the time needed to pair two objects
      further excludes other schemes which rely on manual steps.

   o  Pairing is not necessarily something that is only done once during
      the lifetime of a device.

   o  Is group pairing something to be looked at?  Or can any group key
      establishment be reduced to pairwise pairing with a central master
      device?

   o  Energy and network constraint could be a big issue for the
      imprinting phase.  Especially during installation, there might not
      be power or network connectivity available.

   o  One important design decision is that the compromise of the
      manufacturer must not have any impact on the smart objects which
      have already been imprinted to their new owners.

   o  Industrial users are comfortable when they have to rely on the
      manufacturer during the imprinting phase, but they want to be in

Internet-Draft       Smart Object Security Workshop          August 2012


      exclusive control over their devices afterwards.

   o  The tools used for introducing smart objects should be very
      simple, like a smartphone.  Nevertheless, maybe we overestimate
      the market saturation for smartphones.

   o  For very interface-constrained devices, the solution of using
      (semi)-public information in combination with an online
      manufacturer during imprinting seems like a possible solution.
      There are multiple approaches that sort of work into the same
      direction.  This point is contested among the participants, as it
      requires an Internet connection and since the manufacturer
      effectively knows about the trust relationships of all the devices
      it sells.

   o  What happens if such a device is not enrolled?  What if is only
      enrolled by an attacker?  How should a device behave in this
      situation?  The safest (for the user and the whole grid) would be
      to not allow the device to work if it has not been enrolled.

   o  For a lot of equipment, transferring of ownership, i.e. resetting
      and reselling devices, might not be an issue.

   o  There are many classes of devices where we could assume online
      connectivity to be present, otherwise these devices would not make
      sense in the first place.  But, there are also other devices which
      not to be imprinted completely offline.

   o  Do we really need to talk about security during the very short
      imprinting phase?  Is that realistic?  Especially for very limited
      devices such as lightbulbs.

   o  What will happen if we imprint a lot of smart objects and then our
      controller is destroyed without the possibility to recover?  Here,
      an association with a manufacturer mothership could be a solution.

   Some of the main messages in this slot:

   o  Assuming an interface-constrained device, this initial
      provisioning step is surprisingly hard to get right without making
      too many assumptions about existing information.

   o  There is a limited set of solutions available (based on the type
      of hardware support of the device is available).  The solutions
      for imprinting vary between the enterprise and the consumer
      household scenarios.

   o  The area of provisioning is probably the least formalized of the
      topics discussed during the workshop, and as such open to a lot of
      very different protocols.  The question is whether this is an area
      where the IETF can provide additional guidance, especially since
      there are already a number of solutions being used today.

4.  Summary

   After the topic-slots, the participants of the workshop tried to
   summarize the conclusions to be drawn and the actions to be
   recommended.

   Designing for a smart object environment is about making an
   optimization decision that needs to take the business model, the
   usage scenario, security threats, and the technical constraints into
   account.  To accomplish a certain goal (for example) some design
   aspects may be considered fixed while others may change.  The amount
   of memory available for the sensor may be subject to change depending
   on the amount of functionality needed but there may be a hard limit
   on the costs of the overall product.

   Designing a software update mechanism into the system is crucial to
   ensure that both functionality can be enhanced and that potential
   vulnerabilities can be fixed.  The security threats that users and
   the entire industry cares about may also change over time.

   Work on cryptographic algorithms (like encryption algorithms, hash
   functions, keyed message digests, public key crypto systems) that are
   tailored to smart object environments was not seen as worthwhile by
   the participants.  Many algorithms already exist and standardized
   authentication and key exchange protocols can be customized to use
   the most suitable set of algorithms already.  Instead more work on
   the architectural aspects, i.e., the integration of various protocols
   into a complete system, was considered important to judge the quality
   of a security implementation.
