Internet-Draft            Diameter E2E Security               March 2012


1.  Introduction

   The Diameter base protocol [I-D.ietf-dime-rfc3588bis] leverages IPsec
   and TLS for mutual authentication between neighboring Diameter nodes
   and for channel security offering data origin authentication,
   integrity and confidentiality protection.  The Diameter base
   protocol, however, also defines Diameter agents, namely Relay Agents,
   Proxy Agents, Redirect Agents, and Translation Agents.

   Relay Agents are Diameter agents that accept requests and route
   messages to other Diameter nodes based on information found in the
   messages.  Since Relays do not perform any application level
   processing, they provide relaying services for all Diameter
   applications.

   Similarly to Relays, Proxy Agents route Diameter messages using the
   Diameter routing table.  However, they differ since they modify
   messages to implement policy enforcement.

   Redirect Agents do not relay messages, and only return an answer with
   the information necessary for Diameter agents to communicate
   directly, they do not modify messages.  Redirect Agents do not have
   negative impacts on end-to-end security and are therefore not
   considered in this document.

   A Translation Agent is a device that provides translation between two
   protocols.  To offer end-to-end security across different protocol
   requires the ability to convey and process the AVPs defined in this
   document by both end points.  Since such support is very likely not
   available this document does not cover this functionality.

   This Diameter extension specifies how AVP authentication, integrity
   and confidentiality protection can be offered using either symmetric
   or asymmetric cryptography.  As a solution mechanism Javascript
   Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) is utilized.  JOSE offers a
   simple encoding with small set of features ideal for the purpose of
   Diameter.

   This document focuses on protecting Diameter AVP and leaves the key
   distribution solution to a separate specification.  To offer the
   functionality two AVPs are defined: Signed-Data and Encrypted-Data.

3.  AVP Encoding

3.1.  Signed-Data AVP

   The Signed-Data AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and
   utilizes the JSON Web signature (JWS) mechanism defined in
   [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-signature].

   JWS represents digitally signed or HMACed content using JSON data
   structures.  The representation in [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-signature]
   consists of three parts: the JWS header, the JWS payload, and the JWS
   signature.  This document only makes use of the JWS header and the
   JWS signature - the JWS payload corresponds to the Diameter AVPs that
   shall be protected using a keyed message digest or a digital
   signature.

   To package a set of AVPs for signing, the AVPs are first concatenated
   in the order in which they occur in the Diameter message.  The entire
   AVP MUST be input to the signing process, from the first byte of the
   AVP code to the last byte of the AVP data, including all other
   fields, length, reserved/flags, and optional vendor IDs, and padding.
   The AVP MUST be input to the signing process in network byte order.

   The signature is calculated over all AVPs following the Signed-Data
   AVP.  For the design of the Signed-Data AVP as proposed by this
   document the AVPs themselves are not carried within the Signed-Data
   AVP (for example in the JWT payload).  Instead, the digest is
   computed over these AVPs and placed into the JWS signature.

   If a receiver detects errors with the processing of the Signed-Data
   AVP it may return one of the errors defined in Section 4.

   When AVPs are to be both encrypted and signed, the Encrypted-Data AVP
   MUST be created first.  This means that signing is "outside"
   encryption.

   Here is an example: Imagine the following AVPs from the QoS-Resources
   AVP in the QoS-Install Request (defined in RFC 5866 [RFC5866] message
   shall be signed.  The resulting example message has the following
   structure:

         <QoS-Install-Request> ::= < Diameter Header: 327, REQ, PXY >
                                 < Session-Id >
                                 { Auth-Application-Id }
                                 { Origin-Host }
                                 { Origin-Realm }
                                 { Destination-Realm }
                                 { Auth-Request-Type }
                                 Signed-Data
                                 QoS-Resources

               Example Diameter Message with Signed-Data AVP

   The Signed-Data AVP in this example may contain a JWS Header that
   indicates the use of the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm with the key id
   'abc123':

      {"typ":"JWT",
       "alg":"HS256",
       "kid":"abc123"}

                            Example JWS Header

3.2.  Encrypted-Data AVP

   The Encrypted-Data AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString and
   contains the JSON Web Encryption (JWE) data structure and consists of
   three parts: the JWE Header, the JWE Encrypted Key, and the JWE
   Ciphertext.  The three parts are represented as the concatenation of
   the encoded strings in that order, with the three strings being
   separated by period ('.') characters.  JWE does not add a content
   integrity check if not provided by the underlying encryption
   algorithm.

   A single AVP or an entire list of AVPs MUST be input to the
   encryption process, from the first byte of the AVP code to the last
   byte of the AVP data, including all other fields, length, reserved/
   flags, and optional vendor IDs, and padding.  The AVP MUST be input
   to the encryption process in network byte order, and the encryptor is
   free to order AVPs whatever way it chooses.  When AVPs are to be both
   encrypted and authenticated, the Encrypted-Data AVP MUST be created
   first.

   Note that the usage of the Encrypted-Data AVP requires explicit
   support by the Diameter application since a receiving Diameter node
   must first decrypt the content of the Encrypted-Data AVP in order to
   evaluate the AVPs carried in the message.  In case that a Diameter
   node is unable to understand the Encrypted-Data AVP and ignores the
   AVP then two possible outcomes are possible: First, if the encrypted

   AVPs are optional then their content is not considered by the
   receiving Diameter server without any indication to the sender that
   they have not been processes.  Worse, in the second case when the
   encryptypted AVPs are mandatory to be processed then the receiving
   Diameter node will return an error that may not inform the sender
   about the failure to decrypt the Encrypted-Data AVP.  Consequently,
   the usage of the Encrypted-Data AVP may require changes to the ABNF
   definition of a Diameter application.

   If a receiver detects that the contents of the CMS-Data AVP is
   invalid, it SHOULD return the new Result-Code AVP value defined in
   Section 4.

4.  Result-Code AVP Values

   This section defines new Diameter result code values for usage with
   Diameter applications.

4.1.  Transient Failures

   Errors that fall within the transient failures category are used to
   inform a peer that the request could not be satisfied at the time it
   was received, but MAY be able to satisfy the request in the future.

   DIAMETER_KEY_UNKNOWN (TBD)

      This error code is returned when a Signed-Data or an Encrypted-
      Data AVP is received that was generated using a key that cannot be
      found in the key store.  This error may, for example, be caused if
      one of the endpoints of an end-to-end security association lost a
      previously agreed upon key, perhaps as a result of a reboot.  To
      recover a new end-to-end key establishment procedure may need to
      be invoked.

4.2.  Permanent Failures

   Errors that fall within the permanent failures category are used to
   inform the peer that the request failed, and should not be attempted
   again.

   DIAMETER_DECRYPTION_ERROR (TBD)

      This error code is returned when an Encrypted-Data AVP is received
      and the decryption fails for an unknown reason.

   DIAMETER_SIGNATURE_ERROR (TBD)

      This error code is returned when a Signed-Data AVP is received and
      the verification fails for an unknown reason.

    |                                       AVP  Section               |
    |AVP Name                               Code Defined   Data Type   |
    +------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |Signed-Data                            TBD  3.1       OctetString |
    |Encrypted-Data                         TBD  3.2       OctetString |
    +------------------------------------------------------------------+

   This specification additionally defines a few Result-Code AVP values,
   see Section 4.
