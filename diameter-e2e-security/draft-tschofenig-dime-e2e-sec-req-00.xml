	<t>The Diameter Base specification <xref target="RFC6733"/> offers security protection between neighboring Diameter peers and mandates that either TLS (for TCP), DTLS (for SCTP), or IPsec is used. These security protocols offer a wide range of security properties, including entity authentication, data-origin authentication, integrity, confidentiality protection and replay protection. They also support a large number of cryptographic algorithms, algorithm negotiation, and different types of credentials.</t>

<t>The need to also offer additional security protection of AVPs between non-neighboring Diameter nodes was recognized very early in the work on Diameter. This lead to investigations on a Diameter security extension using Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <xref target="I-D.ietf-aaa-diameter-cms-sec"/>. Due to lack of deployment interest at that time the specification was, however, never completed.</t>

<t>In the meanwhile Diameter had received a lot of deployment interest and due to the sophistication of those deployments the need for protecting Diameter AVPs between non-neighboring nodes re-surfaced. Since early 2000 when the work on <xref target="I-D.ietf-aaa-diameter-cms-sec"/> was discontinued the community had seen advances in cryptography and new requirements emerged.</t>

<t>This document collects requirements for protecting Diameter AVPs.</t>

<t><list style="empty">
<t>QUESTION: What should the scope of the document be? We could focus on requirements document or we could cover architectural aspects.  We are assuming that requirements for automatic key management are out of scope. Is this proper scoping? </t>

          The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD',

	  <section title="Use Case"> 

	  <t>Consider the following use case shown in <xref target="example"/>. A Diameter client interacts with a Diameter server through two Diameter proxies. The Diameter client and the Diameter Proxy A belong to the same realm, example.com.

		  <t>The Diameter AVPs are protected end-to-end, from the Diameter client to the Diameter server, as shown in Figure 1 with the dotted line.</t>

<t>Other use cases are possible as well. For example, Diameter Proxy A could act on behalf of the Diameter clients in the example.com realm. In a general case, however, encryption of AVPs between arbitrary Diameter nodes can be challenging since it is upfront not know what Diameter nodes a message will traverse.</t>

<t><list style="empty">
<t>QUESTION: Should the scope of the work be limited to provide data origin authentication, integrity, and optionally confidentially protection between of selected Diameter AVPs sent by the Diameter client to the Diameter server, and vice versa?</t>

      <section title='Requirements'>
	 
<t>Solutions MUST support an extensible set of cryptographic algorithms.
<list style="empty">
<t>Motivation: Crypto-agility is the ability of a protocol to adapt to evolving cryptographic algorithms and security requirements. This may include the provision of a modular mechanism to allow cryptographic algorithms to be updated without substantial disruption to deployed implementations.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>Solutions MUST support replay protection.</t>

<t>Solutions MUST support confidentiality, integrity, and data-origin authentication.</t>

<t>Solutions MUST be able to selectively apply their cryptographic protection to certain Diameter AVPs.</t>

<t>Solutions MUST recommend a mandatory-to-implement cryptographic algorithm.</t>

<t><list style="empty">
<t>QUESTION: Should solutions for integrity protection work in a backwards-compatible way with existing Diameter applications that support extensions?</t>

<t>QUESTION: Should we support symmetric keys or also asymmetric keys?</t>

<t>QUESTION: Should statically provisioned keys be supported as well or only automatic key management? Should requirements for automatic key management also be covered in this document or in some other document?</t>

</t>


<t><list style="empty">
<t>QUESTION: Should the specification be written in such a way that it allows the provisioning of long-term shared symmetric credentials via a command-line interface / text file in an interoperable way? This would allow simplified configuration.</t>

	<section title="Keying Database">

<t>Diameter nodes maintain different types of databases, depending on their functions.  Examples include the peer table and the routing table. The usage of the security mechanisms described in this document adds another database to those nodes supporting this functionality.
</t>

<t>We describe the keying database in a conceptual way as a table, where each row represents a single symmetric key.</t>

<t>The columns that the table consists of are listed as follows:

<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="LocalKeyName:"> The LocalKeyName is a string identifying the key that has to be used for processing a received Diameter message.</t>

<t hangText="DestinationKeyName:"> The DestinationKeyName on one system matches the LocalKeyName on the other system. This field provides a protocol-specific set of restrictions on the scope in which the key is appropriate. For example, this field is either a host or a realm in the format of a DiameterIdentity.</t>

<t hangText="KDF:">The KDF field indicates which key derivation function is used to generate short-lived keys from the long-lived value in the Key field.  When the long-lived value in the Key field is intended for direct use, the KDF field is set to "none".  This document establishes an IANA registry for the values in the KDF field to simplify references in future specifications. The protocol indicates what (if any) KDFs are valid.</t>

<t hangText="AlgID:">The AlgID field indicates the cryptographic algorithm used with the security protocol. The algorithm may be an encryption algorithm and mode (such as AES-128-CBC), an authentication algorithm (such as HMAC-SHA1-96 or AES-128-CMAC), or any other symmetric cryptographic algorithm needed by a security protocol. If the KDF field contains "none", then the long-lived key is used directly with this algorithm, otherwise the derived short-lived key is used with this algorithm. When the long-lived key is used to generate a set of short-lived keys for use with the security protocol, the AlgID field identifies a ciphersuite rather than a single cryptographic algorithm.</t>

<t hangText="Key:">The Key field contains a long-lived symmetric cryptographic key in the format of a lower-case hexadecimal string.  The size of the Key depends on the KDF and the AlgID.  For instance, a KDF=none and AlgID=AES128 requires a 128-bit key, which is represented by 32 hexadecimal digits.</t>

<t hangText="Direction:">The Direction field indicates whether this key may be used for inbound traffic, outbound traffic,  both, or whether the key has been disabled and may not currently be used at all.  The supported values are "in", "out", "both", and "disabled", respectively.</t>

<t hangText="SendNotBefore:">The NotBefore field specifies the earliest date and time in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) at which this key should be considered for use.  The format is YYYYMMDDHHSSZ, where four digits specify the year, two digits specify the month, two digits specify the day, two digits specify the hour,  two digits specify the minute, and two digits specify the second.  The "Z" is included as a clear indication that the time is in UTC.</t>

<t hangText="SendNotAfter:">The SendNotAfter field specifies the latest date and time at which this key should be considered for use when sending messages.  The format is the same as the SendNotBefore field.</t>

<t hangText="RcvNotBefore:">The RcvNotBefore field specifies the earliest date and time in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) at which this key should be considered for use when processing received messages.  The format is YYYYMMDDHHSSZ, where four digits specify the year, two digits specify the month, two digits specify the day, two digits specify the hour, two digits specify the minute, and two digits specify the second.  The "Z" is included as a clear indication that the time is in UTC.</t>

<t hangText="RcvNotAfter:">The RcvNotAfter field specifies the latest date and time at which this key should be considered for use when processing received traffic.  The format of this field is identical to the format of NotBefore.</t>

<t hangText="KeyManagement:">Specifies whether a entry was statically configured or dynamically discovered.</t>

<t hangText="Protocol:">The Protocol field identifies a single security protocol where this key may be used to provide cryptographic protection.</t>

<t hangText="ProtocolSpecificInfo:">This field contains the protocol-specified information which may be useful for a protocol to apply the key correctly. Note that such information must not be required for a protocol to locate an appropriate key.</t>
