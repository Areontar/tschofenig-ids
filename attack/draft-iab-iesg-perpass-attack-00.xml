<abstract>
<t>
The IETF has consensus that pervasive monitoring is
an attack that should be mitigated via the design of protocols,  where possible. 
</t>
</abstract>

<section title="It's an Attack">

<t>The technical plenary of IETF 88 <xref target="IETF88Plenary"/> discussed pervasive monitoring
and participants strongly agreed that this was an attack and one that
should be mitigated where possible via the design of protocols that make
pervasive monitoring significantly more expensive or infeasible. This Best
Current Practice (BCP) documents that consensus.  </t>

<t>For the purposes of this BCP pervasive monitoring is the widespread
privacy-invasive gathering of protocol artefacts including application content,
protocol meta-data (such as headers) or keys used to secure protocols.  Other
forms of traffic analysis, for example, timing or measuring packet sizes can
also be used for pervasive monitoring.  A full problem statement with more
examples and description can be found in <xref target="ProblemStatement"/>.
Note that more limited-scope monitoring to assist with network management or
that is REQUIRED in order to operate the network or an application
are not considered pervasive monitoring. There is though a clear 
potential for network management mechanisms to be abused as part of
pervasive monitoring, so this tension needs careful consideration in
protocol design.  </t>

<t>The motivation behind pervasive monitoring is not particularly relevant for
this document, but can include non-targetted nation-state surveillance.
Equally, one can envisage non-nation-state actors using similar techniques for
criminal or legal but privacy-unfriendly purposes.</t>

<t>There are various ways in which IETF protocols can be designed
in order to mitigate pervasive monitoring, but those will change
over time as mitigation and attack techniques develop and so are
not described here. This BCP simply records the consensus to 
design protocols so as to mitigate the attack.</t>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>This BCP is all about privacy. More information about the relationship between security and privacy threats can be found in <xref target="RFC6973"/>. Section 5.1.1 of <xref target="RFC6973"/> specifically addresses surveillance as a combined security-privacy threat. </t>

</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

<t>There are none. We hope the RFC editor
deletes this section before publication.</t>

<section title="Acknowledgements">

<t>
We would like to thank the participants of the IETF 88 technical plenary for their feedback. Additionally, we would like to thank all those who contributed to their 
suggestions on how to improve Internet security on various IETF mailing lists, such as the ietf@ietf.org and the perpass@ietf.org lists.
