Internet-Draft     Congestion Control Workshop Report       October 2012


1.  Introduction

   Any application that sends significant amounts of data over the
   Internet is expected to implement reasonable congestion control
   behavior.  Although the specific mechanisms depend on the application
   or protocol, the motivations for congestion control are well
   understood and documented in RFC 2914 [RFC2914] and RFC 5405
   [RFC5405].  The goals are:

   1.  Preventing congestion collapse.

   2.  Allowing multiple flows to share the network fairly.

   The Internet has been used for interactive real-time communication
   for decades, most of which is being transmitted using RTP over UDP,
   often over provisioned capacity and/or using only rudimentary
   congestion control mechanisms.

   The development and upcoming widespread deployment of web-based real-
   time media communication - where RTP is used to and from web browsers
   to transmit audio, video and data - will likely result in substantial
   new Internet traffic.  Due to the projected volume of this traffic,
   as well as the fact that it is more likely to use unprovisioned
   capacity, it is essential that it is transmitted with robust and
   effective congestion control mechanisms.

   Designing congestion control mechanisms that perform well under a
   wide variety of traffic mixes and over network paths with widely
   varying characteristics is not easy.  Prevention of congestion
   collapse can be achieved through "circuit breaker" mechanisms, but
   for media flows that are supposed to coexist with a user's other
   ongoing communication sessions, a congestion control mechanism that
   shares capacity fairly in the presence of a mix of TCP, UDP and other
   protocol flows is needed.

   Many additional complications arise.  Here are some examples:

   1.  Real-time interactive media sessions require low latencies,
       whereas streaming media can use large play-out buffers.

   2.  RTCP feedback about an RTP session typically arrives much less
       frequently than, for example, TCP ACKs for a given TCP
       connection.  The RTP/RTCP control loop can lead to a longer
       reaction time.

   3.  Media codecs can usually only adjust their output rates in a much
       more coarse-grained fashion than, for example, TCP, and user
       experience suffers if encoding rates are switched too frequently.

Internet-Draft     Congestion Control Workshop Report       October 2012


       Codecs typically have a minimum sending rate as well.

   4.  Some bits of an encoded media stream are more important than
       others.  For example, losing or dropping an I-frame of a video
       stream is more problematic than dropping a P-frame.

   5.  Ramping up the transmission rate can be problematic.  Simply
       increasing the output rate of the codec without knowledge whether
       the network path can sustain transmission at the increased rate
       runs the danger of incurring a significant amount of packet loss
       that can cause playback artifacts.

   6.  A congestion control scheme for interactive media needs to handle
       bundles of interrelated flows (audio, video, data), in a way that
       accommodates the preferences of the application in the event of
       congestion.

   7.  The desire to provide a congestion control mechanism that can be
       efficiently implemented inside an application (e.g., a web server
       and a browser) imposes additional restrictions.

   8.  There are explicit congestion signals (such as ECN), and there
       are indirect indications of congestion (such as packet delay and
       loss).  However, congestion is not the only source of these
       indirect signals.  Care must be taken to account for each of
       these signals, particularly if various applications react on the
       same signals.

   9.  Network elements and end device operating systems often create
       buffers to better support TCP-based applications.  These buffers
       introduce additional communication delay, which harms the small
       delay budget available for real-time applications.

   workshop.  The views and positions documented in this report are

2.  History and Current Status

   The currently deployed RTP-based RTC systems use congestion control
   schemes that are ad hoc at best.  As the Internet moves towards an
   RTCWeb standard for interoperable audio/video conferencing, it needs
   a standardized and most importantly effective mechanism for
   congestion control.

   The most immediate need is for a circuit breaker mechanism that stops
   a flow when serious anomalies are detected, i.e., when it is using an
   order of magnitude more bandwidth than a TCP flow would use over the
   given path [I-D.perkins-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers].  This prevents
   the RTCWeb flows from causing long lasting gross over-utilization of
   the network.  Circuit breakers can prevent congestion collapse if
   used correctly, i.e., if the circuit remains disabled for some time
   after the breaker triggers, but does not in any way enable concurrent
   flows to share available network capacity sensibly.

   Therefore, in addition to circuit breakers, more complete methods for
   media congestion control are needed.  The focus of the workshop was
   on discussing ideas for these more complete congestion control
   methods.Note that the primary focus of the workshop is RTCWeb-style
   audio/video flows.  The assumed underlying flows (in most attendees
   minds) were digital audio/video data encapsulated in RTP over UDP
   over IP.  Most of the concepts presented at the workshop could be
   used with different media types over different transports, but this
   was the generally assumed baseline for discussions.

3.  Recommendations

   The participants suggested to explore two complementary solution
   tracks, as described in the two sub-sections below.

3.1.  Changes to Network Infrastructure

   Like for all other traffic on the network, better data plane
   infrastructure improves the perceived quality of the best-effort
   service the Internet provides for RTCWeb flows.  The IETF has already
   developed several technologies that would be of immediate usefulness,
   if they were deployed.  The workshop participants expressed the hope
   that due to the volume and importance of RTCWeb traffic, some of
   these technologies might finally see widespread use.

   The first and by far most important improvement is traffic
   segregation, i.e., the ability to use different queues for different
   traffic types.  Specifically jitter/delay sensitive and throughput
   maximizing protocols need to be in different queues.  It is not
   possible for a single queue/AQM to be optimal for both.

   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) allows routers along the end-
   to-end path to signal the onset of congestion and allows applications
   to respond early, avoiding losses and keep queue sizes short and
   therefore end-to-end delay low.  ECN is not widely implemented on end
   system stacks and on routers, but when implemented it is frequently
   not enabled.

   Different mechanisms have been developed to facilitate traffic
   segregation.  Differentiated services are one possibility in this
   space if applications start to mark outgoing traffic appropriately
   and routers would segregate traffic accordingly, browsers could more
   directly control the relative importance of their various flows, and
   avoid self-competition.  Compared to ECN, however, DiffServ is far
   more difficult to deploy meaningfully end-to-end, especially given
   that DSCPs have no defined end-to-end meaning and packets can be re-
   marked.  Quality-of-service (QoS) signaling together with resource
   reservation facilities would enable a fine-grained and flexible way
   to indicate resource needs to network elements but it is also by far
   the most heavyweight proposal.

   However, any change to network infrastructure will take time
   particularly if the interest of the involved stakeholders is not
   aligned (as it is the case for network operators and over-the-top
   application providers).  It is therefore imperative that RTCWeb
   congestion control provides adequate improvement in the absence of
   any of the aforementioned schemes.

3.2.  Avoiding Self-Inflicted Queuing

   This approach tries to ensure that the network does not get
   congested.  This is of course difficult to accomplish for a single
   end host by itself.  As such, the focus of this solution approach for
   congestion control for real-time media is about data that is
   transmitted by a single browser, a single application, or at best by
   a single end host.

   The following activities were suggested during the workshop.

   o  Need an algorithm that reacts to all signals.  Feedback signals
      come in various forms:

      *  RTCP reports, delay, loss, correlation between signal and
         jitter, etc.

      *  Use explicit congestion signal, if available, such as ECN.

   o  Achieve low latency with algorithm design:

      *  Delay based algorithms are needed in this mode.  The wide range
         of normal delay variation in a non-congested network must be
         considered in designing delay based algorithms.

      *  Need not to fail when competing with TCP in case of losses.

   o  Congestion control algorithms should be evaluated under realistic
      loss and delay conditions to be sure that the desired audio/video
      rates are attainable using the proposed algorithms for the desired
      service.

   o  A congestion controller needs to be aware that media is inherently
      variable and it may be possible to associate the current
      congestion situation with the currently chosen encoding.  However,
      investigation is need to decide what information (if any) needs to
      be exchanged between the codec and the congestion control
      algorithm.  Codecs have room for adaptation but it is often
      limited.

   o  Startup behavior?

   In addition, there were some discussions on how to make RTCWeb-style
   flows fair to other RTCWeb-style flows, other TCP based flows, LEDBAT
   flows, and other flows.  This is a much more difficult problem than
   simply making RTCWeb flows avoid congestion.

   The following topics also fall into short term deployment time-frame

   o  Change the way TCP is used in browsers.  For example , avoid
      opening too many concurrent TCP connections, and improved
      interworking with video streaming and file sharing software.

   o  Development of a single congestion manager at the end host or
      within the browser
