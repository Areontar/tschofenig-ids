                     draft-rosen-ecrit-ecall-09.txt

Abstract

   This document describes how to re-use the emergency services
   mechanisms specified for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to
   accomplishing emergency calling support in vehicles.  Profiling and
   simplifications are possible due to the nature of the functionality
   that is going to be provided in vehicles with the usage of Global
   Positioning System (GPS).

1.  Introduction

   Emergency calls made from vehicles can assist with the objective of
   significantly reducing road deaths and injuries.  Unfortunately,
   drivers often have a poor location-awareness, especially on urban
   roads (also during night) and abroad.  In the most crucial cases, the
   victim(s) may not be able to call because they have been injured or
   trapped.

   In Europe the European Commission has launched the 'eCall' initiative
   that may best be described as a user initiated or automatically
   triggered system to provide notifications to Public Safety Answering
   Point's (PSAP), by means of cellular communications, that a vehicle
   has crashed, and to provide geodetic location information and where
   possible a voice channel to the PSAP.  At the time of writing the
   support for eCall is focused on legacy mobile circuit switched voice
   technology.  This document details how the same functionality (and
   even more) can be accomplished using Internet protocols and SIP.  The
   goal is to re-use existing specifications in the area of SIP-based
   emergency calling.

   This document is organized as follows: Section 2 defines the
   terminology, Section 3 describes how the required functionality can
   be accomplished by combining several already existing standards, and
   Section 4 shows an example message exchange.  This document concludes
   with the security considerations in Section 5 and IANA considerations

   in Section 6.  Appendix A illustrates how to map the functionality in
   this document to the eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD) specified for
   mobile circuit switched voice.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document re-uses terminology defined in Section 3 of [RFC5012].

3.  Profile

   In the context of emergncy calls placed from a vehicle it is assumed
   that the car is equipped with a built-in GPS receiver.  For this
   reason only geodetic location information will be sent within an
   emergency call.  The following location shapes MUST be implemented:
   2d and 3d Point (see Section 5.2.1 of [RFC5491]), Circle (see
   Section 5.2.3 of [RFC5491]), and Ellipsoid (see Section 5.2.7 of
   [RFC5491]).  The coordinate reference systems (CRS) specified in
   [RFC5491] are also mandatory for this document.  The <direction>
   element, as defined in [RFC5962] which indicates the direction of
   travel of the vehicle, is important for dispatch and hence it MUST be
   included in the PIDF-LO . The <heading> element specified in
   [RFC5962] MUST be implemented and MAY be included.

   This specification also inherits the ability to utilize test call
   functionality from Section 15 of [RFC6881].

4.  Example

   Figure 1 shows an emergency call placed from a vehicle whereby
   location information information is directly attached to the SIP
   INVITE message itself.  The call is marked as an emergency call using
   the 'urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic' service URN and the PSAP of the
   VoIP provider determines which PSAP to contact based on the provided
   location information.  The emergency call continues towards the PSAP
   and in this example it hits the ESRP, as the entry point to the PSAP
   operators emergency services network.  Finally, the emergency call
   will be received by a call taker and first reponders will be
   dispatched.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise security considerations beyond those
   described in [RFC5069].  As with emergency service systems with end
   host provided location information there is the possibility that that
   location is incorrect, either intentially (in case of an a denial of
   service attack against the emergency services infrastructure) or due
   to a malfunctioning devices.  The reader is referred to
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-trustworthy-location] for a discussion of some of
   these vulnerabilities.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the URN 'urn:service:sos.ecall' under
   the sub-services 'sos' registry defined in Section 4.2 of [RFC5031].

   This service identifier reaches a public safety answering point
   (PSAP), which in turn dispatches aid appropriate to the emergency
   related to accidents of vehicles.  Two sub-services are registered as
   well, namely

   urn:service:sos.ecall.manual

      This service URN indicates that an eCall had been triggered based
      on the manual interaction of the driver or a passenger.

   urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic

Internet-Draft     IP-based In-Vehicle Emergency Call         April 2013


      This service URN indicates that an eCall had been triggered
      automatically, for example, due to a crash.  No human involvement
      was detected.

Appendix A.  Matching Functionality with eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD)

   [eCall-MSD] outlines a number of data elements that are transmitted
   in an emergency call triggered by a vehicle.  Note that the work on
   eCall for mobile circuit switched voice is constrained in a number of
   ways since legacy eCall uses an inband voice modem for backwards
   compatibility with the already deployed cellular infrastructure to
   transmit data from a vehicle to a PSAP.  Since the functionality in
   this document is based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) these
   limitations do not exist.  As such, it is not useful to transmit the
   MSD inband in the voice channel but to rather use the SIP mechanisms
   standardized for emergency call handling.  Any voice, video, or real-
   text communication will be negotiated using the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP), as shown in Figure 2, and the actual media stream
   will then take place in RTP packets.  For transmitting location
   information an XML-based data structure had been defined, the so-
   called Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO).

   The following list compares the eCall minimum set of data with the
   functionality provided in this document.

Internet-Draft     IP-based In-Vehicle Emergency Call         April 2013


   Version of the MSD Format:  Conveying information in a SIP-based
      emergency call is accomplished by using XML payloads and XML
      provides namespace declarations that allow a receipient of that
      information to distinguish different versions and additional
      extensions.  For example, if additional data about a vehicle is
      defined and can be transmitted by vehicle then a respective
      extension can be defined inside the additional data XML structure
      [I-D.ietf-ecrit-additional-data].  Selecting the appropriate
      extension point depends on the type of extension envisioned.

   Message Identifier:  Every SIP INVITE message contains a Call-ID,
      which is a globally unique identifier for this call.

   Vehicle Type Encoding:  [Editor's Note: Description to be added.].

   Test Call Indication  A service URN starting with "test."  indicates
      a request for an automated test.  For example,
      "urn:service:test.sos.ecall.automatic" indicates such a test
      feature.  This functionality is defined in [RFC6881].

   Automatic Activation Indication:  This document registers new service
      URNs, which allow the differentiation between manually and
      automatically triggered emergency calls.  The two service URNs
      are: urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic and
      urn:service:sos.ecall.manual

   Vehicle Identification:  The PIDF data structure contains a deviceID
      field that holds the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).

   Vehicle Propulsion Storage type:  These parameters identify the type
      of vehicle energy storage(s) present.  [Editor's Note: Description
      to be added.]

   Timestamp of Incident Event:  The PIDF-LO element contains the
      timestamp when the PIDF-LO was created, which is at the time of
      the incident.

   Vehicle Location:  The location of the vehicle is conveyed using the
      PIDF location objection, as described in Section 3.

   Vehicle Direction:  The direction of the vehicle is part of location
      information, as described in Section 3.

   Recent Vehicle Location:  With this optional functionality multiple
      location objects may be required to be transported simultaneously.
      This can be achieved using <timed-presence>, defined in RFC 4481
      [RFC4481].
