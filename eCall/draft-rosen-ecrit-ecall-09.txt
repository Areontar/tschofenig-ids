           Internet Protocol-based In-Vehicle Emergency Call
                     draft-rosen-ecrit-ecall-09.txt

Abstract

   This document describes how to re-use the emergency services
   mechanisms specified for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to
   accomplishing emergency calling support in vehicles.  Profiling and
   simplifications are possible due to the nature of the functionality
   that is going to be provided in vehicles with the usage of Global
   Positioning System (GPS).

1.  Introduction

   Emergency calls made from vehicles can assist with the objective of
   significantly reducing road deaths and injuries.  Unfortunately,
   drivers often have a poor location-awareness, especially on urban
   roads (also during night) and abroad.  In the most crucial cases, the
   victim(s) may not be able to call because they have been injured or
   trapped.

   In Europe the European Commission has launched the 'eCall' initiative
   that may best be described as a user-initiated or automatically
   triggered system to provide notifications to Public Safety Answering
   Point's (PSAP), by means of cellular communications, that a vehicle
   has crashed, and to provide geodetic location information and where
   possible a voice channel to the PSAP.

   Current (circuit-switched or legacy) systems for placing emergency
   calls from vehicles, including automatic crash notification system,
   generally use one of three architectural models: TSP, direct, and
   paired handset.  These three models are illustrated below.

   In the TSP model the TSP operator communicates location and crash
   data to PSAP verbally.

                           Figure 1: TSP Model.

   In the paired model the IVS communicates location data to PSAP via
   text-to-speech; no crash data.

                 ++
   ///----\\\    ||       911 voice call via handset   +------+
      IVS    --->|+----------------------------------->+ PSAP |
   \\\----///    ++                                    +------+

                          Figure 2: Paired Model

   In the direct model the IVS communicates location and crash data to
   PSAP via eCall in-band modem in voice call.

   ///----\\\        911/112 voice call via IVS        +------+
      IVS    ----------------------------------------->+ PSAP |
   \\\----///                                          +------+

                          Figure 3: Direct Model

   The migration to next-generation (all-IP) would then look like as
   follows.  In the TSP model the TSP transmits crash data using
   Internet protocols.

   ///----\\\  proprietary  +------+ NG911/NG112 call  +------+
      IVS     ------------->+ TSP  +------------------>+ PSAP |
   \\\----///  or standard  +------+                   +------+

                            Figure 4: TSP Model

   In the paired model, the IVS uses a Bluetooth link to a previously-
   paired handset to establish an emergency call with the PSAP; it is
   not clear what facilities are or will be available for transmitting
   crash data.

                 ++
   ///----\\\    ||                                    +------+

   \\\----///    ++                                    +------+

                          Figure 5: Paired Model

   In the direct model the IVS communicates crash data to PSAP using
   Internet protocols.

                          Figure 6: Direct Model

   This document is focused on the interface to the PSAP, that is, how
   an emergency call (including location and crash data) is setup and
   data is transmitted to the PSAP using existing IETF specifications.
   The goal is to re-use existing specifications rather than to invent
   new.  For the direct model (such as the European eCall), this is the
   end-to-end description.  For the TSP model, this describes the right-
   hand side, leaving the left-hand side up to the entities involved
   (e.g., IVS and TSP vendors) who are then free to use the same
   mechanism as for the right-hand side or not.

   Appendix A explains how the functionality available in IETF
   specifications maps to the functionality provided by the Minimum Set
   of Data (MSD) of the mobile circuit switched voice solution [13].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   This document re-uses terminology defined in Section 3 of [9].

3.  Profile

   In the context of emergncy calls placed from a vehicle it is assumed
   that the car is equipped with a built-in GPS receiver.  For this
   reason only geodetic location information will be sent within an
   emergency call.  The following location shapes MUST be implemented:
   2d and 3d Point (see Section 5.2.1 of [3]), Circle (see Section 5.2.3
   of [3]), and Ellipsoid (see Section 5.2.7 of [3]).  The coordinate
   reference systems (CRS) specified in [3] are also mandatory for this
   document.  The <direction> element, as defined in [6] which indicates
   the direction of travel of the vehicle, is important for dispatch and
   hence it MUST be included in the PIDF-LO . The <heading> element
   specified in [6] MUST be implemented and MAY be included.

   This specification also inherits the ability to utilize test call
   functionality from Section 15 of [4].

Internet-Draft     IP-based In-Vehicle Emergency Call          July 2013


   Figure 7 shows an emergency call placed from a vehicle whereby
   location information information is directly attached to the SIP
   INVITE message itself.  The call is marked as an emergency call using
   the 'urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic' service URN and the PSAP of the
   VoIP provider determines which PSAP to contact based on the provided
   location information.  The emergency call continues towards the PSAP
   and in this example it hits the ESRP, as the entry point to the PSAP
   operators emergency services network.  Finally, the emergency call
   will be received by a call taker and first reponders will be
   dispatched.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise security considerations beyond those
   described in [10].  As with emergency service systems with end host
   provided location information there is the possibility that that
   location is incorrect, either intentially (in case of an a denial of
   service attack against the emergency services infrastructure) or due
   to a malfunctioning devices.  The reader is referred to [11] for a
   discussion of some of these vulnerabilities.

Internet-Draft     IP-based In-Vehicle Emergency Call          July 2013


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the URN 'urn:service:sos.ecall' under
   the sub-services 'sos' registry defined in Section 4.2 of [8].

   This service identifier reaches a public safety answering point
   (PSAP), which in turn dispatches aid appropriate to the emergency
   related to accidents of vehicles.  Two sub-services are registered as
   well, namely

   urn:service:sos.ecall.manual

      This service URN indicates that an eCall had been triggered based
      on the manual interaction of the driver or a passenger.

   urn:service:sos.ecall.automatic

      This service URN indicates that an eCall had been triggered
      automatically, for example, due to a crash.  No human involvement
      was detected.

Appendix A.  Matching Functionality with eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD)

Internet-Draft     IP-based In-Vehicle Emergency Call          July 2013


   [13] outlines a number of data elements that are transmitted in an
   emergency call triggered by a vehicle.  Note that the work on eCall
   for mobile circuit switched voice is constrained in a number of ways
   since legacy eCall uses an inband voice modem for backwards
   compatibility with the already deployed cellular infrastructure to
   transmit data from a vehicle to a PSAP.  Since the functionality in
   this document is based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) these
   limitations do not exist.  As such, it is not useful to transmit the
   MSD inband in the voice channel but to rather use the SIP mechanisms
   standardized for emergency call handling.  Any voice, video, or real-
   text communication will be negotiated using the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP), as shown in Figure 8, and the actual media stream
   will then take place in RTP packets.  For transmitting location
   information an XML-based data structure had been defined, the so-
   called Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO).

   The following list compares the eCall minimum set of data with the
   functionality provided in this document.

   Version of the MSD Format:  Conveying information in a SIP-based
      emergency call is accomplished by using XML payloads and XML
      provides namespace declarations that allow a receipient of that
      information to distinguish different versions and additional
      extensions.  For example, if additional data about a vehicle is
      defined and can be transmitted by vehicle then a respective
      extension can be defined inside the additional data XML structure
      [7].  Selecting the appropriate extension point depends on the
      type of extension envisioned.

   Message Identifier:  Every SIP INVITE message contains a Call-ID,
      which is a globally unique identifier for this call.

   Vehicle Type Encoding:  [Editor's Note: Description to be added.].

   Test Call Indication  A service URN starting with "test." indicates a
      request for an automated test.  For example,
      "urn:service:test.sos.ecall.automatic" indicates such a test
      feature.  This functionality is defined in [4].

   Automatic Activation Indication:  This document registers new service
