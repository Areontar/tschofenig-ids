1.  Introduction

   Diameter was developed to provide an Authentication, Authorization,
   and Accounting (AAA) framework for a number of applications,
   including network access, mobility, and real-time multimedia
   application layer services.  Over the last 10 years it has enjoyed
   widespread industry acceptance and can be found in many large
   (mobile) operator networks.

   When a Diameter server becomes overloaded, it may need to gracefully
   reduce its load and there are two basic approaches for doing so:
   redistributing requests to other Diameter servers (load balancing)
   and by informing Diameter clients to reject requests. [3] aims to
   provide background information and requirements.  This document
   defines the next step, namely the architecture and the information
   model.

2.  Terminology

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
   'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
   specification are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   This document re-uses terminology from the Diameter base
   specification [2].

   The term "load balancer" in this document refers to a Diameter proxy
   that uses load information of Diameter servers and configuration
   seetings to adjust standard Diameter routing.

3.  Architectural Principles

   This section outlines several principles guiding the solution design.

   Avoid premature optimizations.  Diameter is an extensible protocol
      and new extensions can be added at any time (when necessary).
      Instead of developing the most "complete" solution there are
      benefits from starting with a minimal core that helps to gain
      initial implementation and deployment experience.  This minimal
      core can then be used as a basis for subsequent refinements.
      Complexity often comes with optimizations and constraints imposed
      by incremental deployment strategies.

   Focus on real-world problems.  The number of theoretical use cases is
      large, almost unbounded.  What use cases and optimizations are
      worthwhile to explore and to standardize solutions for?  Is the
      "sounds good" test enough or is evidence of a documented and
      reproducable real-world problem needed?

   Overload conditions are rare events.  The Diameter backend
      infrastructure is hopefully dimensioned in a way that overload
      situations are the exception rather than the norm.  Consequently,
      it is less useful to develop many optimization for those rare
      events (e.g., optimizations in the form of message reduction).
      Instead, it is more beneficial to optimize for the case where
      there is no overload.

   Consider advances in information technology.  At the time of writing
      cloud computing and virtualization has gained widespread industry
      interest, even in the telecommunication sector.  These new
      computing paradigms provide built-in support for handling load
      variation (e.g., by spawning new virtual machines or migrating
      code).  The orchestration and management of these virtual machine
      instances is often provided in a centralized fashion using a
      hypervisor and these hypervisors come with management interfaces
      that obtain load and other status information from their virtual
      machine instances.  It is not unlikely that these developments
      will also impact deployments of Diameter servers within a single
      administrative domain.

   Load Balancing and Rejecting Requests are different.  Load balancing
      is a technique that is best applied within a local administrative
      domain to re-distribute requests.  For maximum benefit knowledge
      by the load balancer about the system architecture and the nature



Tschofenig              Expires January 16, 2014                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         Diameter AVP Level Security             July 2013


      of applications is required.  Rejecting requests, on the other
      hand, requires information signaling to the Diameter clients since
      Diameter is not an end-to-end protocol and information about the
      failure situation needs to be passed along to the source of the
      end system, such as VoIP phones initiating phone calls, end
      devices seeking network access.

   Delegating rejection policies creates a lot of complexity.  When a
      Diameter server reaches an overload state and wants to reduce the
      number of requests it gets it has a number of choices.  In the
      simplest form it could return reject responses without engaging in
      heavy application specific processing.  In such a model the
      Diameter server acts as a Policy Decision Point (PDP) and as a
      Policy Enforcement Point (PEP).  By co-locating the PEP and the
      PDP the decision making is implementation internal, which is also
      the beautify of this model.  If the PEP functionality, however,
      gets moved to the Diameter client (or to any other node) the need
      for standardizing a "Diameter request rejection policy language"
      arises.  Delegating functionality from the PEP to the PEP requires
      the PEP to have a reasonable amount of information about the
      problem the Diameter server and the support infrastructure is
      facing.  Additionally, the PEP would benefit from knowing about
      the tradeoff decisions the network operators wants to make
      regarding the different types of requests.

4.  Information Exchanges

4.1.  End-to-End Overload Feedback

   The information elements described in this document follow the
   pattern shown in Figure 1.  Following the exchange of Diameter
   application messages between a Diameter client and a Diameter server
   (through zero or more Diameter intermediaries) a Diameter server may
   indicate that it is currently suffering an overload situation.  To
   ensure that the load information is understood by the Diameter client
   a prior capability exchange is provided.


                              Overload     +  Rejection
                              Information     Policies

     Figure 1: Information Exchange for End-to-End Overload Feedback.

   The basic functionality starts with the support of DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY,
   which is defined in the Diameter Base specification.  While it does
   indeed not provide information to the Diameter client about how it
   react on future Diameter messages.  While this can be seen as a
   design weakness it also has the benefit of a lower standardization
   need and minimal implementation complexity.  This document defines
   the information elements that can be used by an existing Diameter
   application to convey overload information.

   The necessary AVPs are defined in the Section 5.1 and in Section 5.2.

4.2.  Load Balancing

   Figure 2 shows the information exchange between different Diameter
   servers and a load balancer within the same administrative domain.
   Following the cpability exchange between the load balancer and the
   Diameter servers load information is exchanged.  Incoming Diameter
   requests are distributed based on the collected load information and
   based on the configuration of the load balancer.

5.  Information Elements

5.1.  Capability Indication

5.1.1.  Supported-Features AVP

   The Supported-Features AVP (AVP code TBD) is of type Uint64, and
   contains a bitmap that allows the Diameter client to inform the
   Diameter server about the functionality it supports.  This scheme
   allows for up to 64 total scopes to be supported.


   +---------+-----------------------+
   | Bitmask | Feature               |
   +---------+-----------------------+
   | 0000001 | [TBD: This document.] |
   +---------+-----------------------+



5.1.2.  Sending-Rate AVP

   The Sending-Rate AVP (AVP Code TBD10) is of type Unsigned32 and
   indicates the time in milliseconds between subsequent load updates.
   Higher values lead to fewer load updates and therefore reduce the
   signaling overhead but lead to less up-to-date information.

5.2.  Information for Rejecting Diameter Requests

5.2.1.  Overload-Info AVP

   The Overload-Info AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped, and is used
   as a top-level container for information about the overload status.

   The grouped data field of the Overload-Info AVP has the following
   grammar:


              < Overload-Info > ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                                { Overload }
                                [ Period-Of-Validity ]
                              * [ AVP ]



5.2.2.  Period-Of-Validity AVP

Internet-Draft         Diameter AVP Level Security             July 2013


   The Period-Of-Validity AVP (AVP code TBD) is of type Unsigned32, and
   is used to indicate the length of time, in seconds, the Overload-
   Metric is to be considered valid.  The maximum value in this AVP is 5
   minutes, which is also the default value.  If this AVP is absent in a
   subsequent message then the indicated value is valid till the next
   overload report is received.

5.2.3.  Overload AVP

   The Overload AVP (AVP code TBD) is of type Enumerated.  Four values
   are defined:

   NO_OVERLOAD                  0  The Diameter server uses this value
      to indicate that it is currently not overload and that the
      Diameter client should not reject any request.

   INCREASING_OVERLOAD          1  The Diameter server uses this value
      to inform the client that overload has increased and that the
      Diameter client shall decrease the sending rate.

   DECREASING_OVERLOAD          2  The Diameter server uses this value
      to inform the client that the overload situation has improved and
      that the Diameter client is allowed to increase the rate of
      Diameter requests.

   OVERLOADED                   3  The Diameter server uses this value
      to inform the client that it is completely overloaded and cannot
      further process any requests.

5.3.  Information Elements for Loadbalancing

5.3.1.  Load-Info AVP

   The Load-Info AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Grouped, and is used as a
   top-level container for information about the load status.

   The grouped data field of the Load-Info AVP has the following
   grammar:


              < Load-Info > ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                                { Load }
                              * [ AVP ]



5.3.2.  Load AVP




Tschofenig              Expires January 16, 2014                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         Diameter AVP Level Security             July 2013


   The Load AVP (AVP code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.  The indicated
   value MUST be between 0 and 10.  The semantics of the values are as
   follows: a Diameter server indicating a value of zero (0) notifies a
   load balancer that there is no overload condition.  A Diameter server
   indicating a value of ten (10) indicates that it is experiencing
   extreme overload and cannot process any further requests.  The
   remaining other values express situations between these two extremes.
   Note that there is no requirement that the Diameter server reports
   values in incremental steps; a Diameter server may, for whatever
   reason, notice that it needs to report a value of 10 even though it
   had previously reported a value of 0.  A load balancer receiving
   values other than 0 MUST reduce the sending rate of Diameter requests
   to the Diameter server correspondingly.

   Note that the load value does not refer to any specific resource,
   such as CPU utilization, database interconnection, etc.  The value is
   computed locally by the Diameter server based on an algorithm that is
   not further specified.  Implementers should, however, ensure that the
   resources that matter for the specific Diameter deployment are taken
   into account in defining the algorithm.  The lack of a standardized
   algorithm does, however, not impact interoperability.  A loadbalancer
   provided by vendor A and Diameter servers provided by vendor B will
   interoperate because they make decisions based on these artificial
   values.  For example, a network operator may decide to configure the
   load balancer in such a way that the second server is only used once
   the load value of the first server reaches a certain threshold.

   The lifetime of the load information is bound to the value
   communicated in the Sending-Rate AVP during the capability exchange.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes architectural principles and an information
   model.  Security considerations are described in the documents that
   utilize these AVPs.

7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD: Create registry for supported feature AVP and register AVPs
   defined in the document.
