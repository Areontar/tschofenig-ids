                   Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0
                     draft-ietf-oauth-assertions-04

Abstract

   This specification provides a framework for the use of assertions
   with OAuth 2.0 in the form of new client authentication mechanism and
   a new authorization grant type.  This document specifies a mechanism
   for transporting assertions during interactions with a token
   endpoint, as well as processing rules.

   The intent of this specification is let OAuth 2.0 interwork with
   other identity management systems, and to provide alternative
   security mechanisms.

   Note that this specification only defines abstract message flows and
   processing rules and that companion specifications are necessary to
   provide the corresponding instantiation in order to be implementable.

Internet-Draft      Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0          June 2012


1.  Introduction

   OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] is an authorization protocol that
   enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to a
   protected resource, either on behalf of a resource owner by
   orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and
   the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to
   obtain access on its own behalf.

   Figure 1 shows the abstract OAuth 2.0 protocol exchanges graphically.
   In step (C) the client presents the authorization grant to the
   authorization server in exchange for an access token.  This access
   token is then used by the client in step (E) to access a protected
   resource at the resource server.  In addition to presenting the
   access token to the resource server in most use cases the client also
   needs to authenticate itself to the resource server, which is
   referred as client authentication.

                Figure 1: Abstract OAuth 2.0 Protocol Flow

   This document allows the OAuth 2.0 framework to be enhanced to make
   use of assertions in two phases of the described protocol exchange,
   namely

   Assertions as a new Authorization Grant Type:

      An authorization grant is a credential representing the resource
      owner's authorization (to access its protected resources) used by
      the client to obtain an access token.  Several authorization grant

      types are defined in [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] to support a wide range
      of usage scenarios, namely authorization code, implicit, resource
      owner password credentials, and client credentials, as well as an
      extensibility mechanism for defining additional types.

      This document defines such an additional grant type where an
      assertion can be used by the client to obtain an access token.
      This step concerns the exchange in step (C) and step (D) of
      Figure 1.

   Assertions as a new Client Authentication Mechanism:

      Section 2 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] describes the process for client
      registration, the types of clients, and also defines two client
      authentication mechanisms in Section 2.3.1 using HTTP Basic and a
      custom OAuth security mechanism.

      This document defines a new client authentication mechanism that
      utilizes assertions.  This step concerns the exchange in step (E)
      and step (F) of Figure 1.

   Note: The use of assertions for client authentication is orthogonal
   to the usage of assertions for authorization grants.  They two can be
   used either in combination or in isolation.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] .

   Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
   to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages,
   the quotes must not be used as part of the value.


3.  Framework

   An assertion is a package of information including issuer and
   subject, conditions, and/or attribute statements, and/or
   authentication statements and/or other statements.  Statements may or
   may not be present.  Note: Assertions MUST always be protected
   against tampering using a digital signature or a keyed message digest
   applied by the issuer.  An assertion MAY additionally be encrypted to
   prevent unauthorized parties from inspecting the content.

   Typically, an assertion "container" contains the following:



Mortimore, et al.       Expires December 26, 2012               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0          June 2012


   Issuing information:

      Who issued the assertion, when was it issued and the assertion
      identifier.

   Subject information:

      The name of the subject, the security domain and optional subject
      information, like a public key.

   Conditions under which the assertion is valid:

      Special kinds of conditions, such as the validity period or one-
      time-use, may be included.

   Assertions may also contain attribute statements and authentication
   statements.  Here are explanatory examples:

      With an assertion containing an attribute statement, an issuing
      authority is asserting that the subject is associated with certain
      attributes with certain subject profile attribute values.  For
      example, user jon@cs.example.com is associated with the attribute
      "Department", which has the value "Computer Science".

      With an assertion containing an authentication statement, an
      issuing authority is asserting that the subject was authenticated
      by certain means at a certain time.

   In addition to the content of the assertions a security relevant
   aspect is also who created these assertions, i.e., who is the
   issuer?, and what relationship exists between the issuer and the
   relying party.  Note that we use the term relying party instead of
   authorization server or resource server.

   In our context there are two possible scenarios, as shown in Figure 2
   and in Figure 3.  This document supports both usages and deployments
   need to determine the best possible variant based on the required
   level of security.  These two usages are always applicable when
   assertions are used for client authentication and/or authorization
   grants.  As such, in a single protocol exchange two assertions may be
   used and these two assertions may have different security properties,
   as explained below.

   Third party created assertion assume some protocol mechanism to exist
   to allow an OAuth client to submit a request for a new assertion to a
   newly introduced entity, called the 'Token Service'.  The token
   service is an entity capable of issuing, renewing, transforming and
   validating of security tokens.  This is shown in step (1).  The role

Internet-Draft      Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0          June 2012


   of the token service is to obtain requests for authenticated clients
   and to mint assertions as requested, to fill the assertion with
   verified information, and to sign them afterwards.  When the token
   service returns the assertion to the client in step (2) the client
   performs two possible actions before continuing the protocol
   interaction with the relying party as shown in step (3):

   1.  The client may use the assertion as a proof-of-possession token,
       which requires a secure communication channel between the relying
       party and the client to avoid leaking the assertion to
       unauthorized parties.

   2.  The client may need to demonstrate possession of cryptographic
       keying material that has to be applied to the request.  This
       concept is also known as 'holder-of-the-key'.  The token service
       thereby binds a key identifier to the assertion and the client
       has to demonstrate to the relying party that it knows the key
       corresponding to that identifier when presenting the assertion in
       step (3).  This mechanism provides additional security
       properties.

                  Figure 2: Third Party created Assertion

   In Figure 3 we show the second possible usage scneario where the
   client creates assertions locally.  In order to sign the assertion it
   has to obtain keying material (either a symmetric key or an
   assymetric key pair out-of-band).  Any information that is included
   in the assertion by the client itself will typically be of limited
   value to the relying party and for this reason only a bare minimum is
   included in such an assertion, such as issuing information.

4.  Transporting Assertions

   This section defines HTTP parameters for transporting assertions for
   the interaction with a token endpoint.

4.1.  Using Assertions as Authorization Grants

   This section defines the use of assertions as authorization grants
   based on the definition provided in Section 4.5 of OAuth 2.0
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2].  When using assertions as authorization grants,
   the client includes the assertion and related information using the
   following HTTP request parameters:

   grant_type:  REQUIRED.  This field indicates the format of the
      assertion.  Specifications defining new assertion types MUST be
      registered their assertion type as a sub-type of
      'urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type'.  The
      'urn:ietf:params:oauth' registry and their sub-registries is
      defined in [I-D.ietf-oauth-urn-sub-ns].

   assertion:  REQUIRED.  The assertion being used as an authorization
      grant.  Specific serialization of the assertion is defined by
      profile documents.  The serialization MUST be encoded for
      transport within HTTP forms.  It is RECOMMENDED that base64url be
      used.

Internet-Draft      Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0          June 2012


   scope:  OPTIONAL.  The requested scope as described in Section 3.3 of
      OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2].  When exchanging assertions for
      access tokens, the authorization for the token has been previously
      granted through some out-of-band mechanism.  As such, the
      requested scope MUST be equal or lesser than the scope originally
      granted to the authorized accessor.  If the scope parameter and/or
      value is omitted, the scope MUST be treated as equal to the scope
      originally granted to the authorized accessor.  The Authorization
      Server MUST limit the scope of the issued access token to be equal
      or lesser than the scope originally granted to the authorized
      accessor.

   The following non-normative example demonstrates an assertion being
   used as an authorization grant (with line breaks for display purposes
   only):
   POST /token HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Asaml2-bearer&
   assertion=PHNhbWxwOl...[omitted for brevity]...ZT4

   The assertion is a short lived representation of the authorization
   grant and authorization servers SHOULD NOT issue access tokens that
   exceed that lifetime by a significant period.  [EDITOR's NOTE: '...
   exceed that lifetime' - what lifetime] In practice, that will usually
   mean that refresh tokens are not issued in response to assertion
   grant requests and access tokens will be issued with a reasonably
   short lifetime.  Clients can refresh an expired access token by
   requesting a new one using the same assertion, if it is still valid,
   or with a new assertion.

4.1.1.  Error Responses

   If an assertion is not valid or has expired, the Authorization Server
   MUST construct an error response as defined in OAuth 2.0
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2].  The value of the "error" parameter MUST be the
   "invalid_grant" error code.  The authorization server MAY include
   additional information regarding the reasons the assertion was
   considered invalid using the "error_description" or "error_uri"
   parameters.

   For example:

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
     "error":"invalid_grant",
     "error_description":"Audience validation failed"
   }

4.2.  Using Assertions for Client Authentication

   The following section defines the use of assertions as client
   credentials as an extension of Section 2.3 of OAuth 2.0
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2].  When using assertions as client credentials,
   the client includes the assertion and related information using the
   following HTTP request parameters:

   client_id:  OPTIONAL.  The client identifier as described in Section
      2.2 of OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2].  When present, the
      "client_id" MUST identify the client to the authorization server.

   client_assertion_type:  REQUIRED.  This field indicates the format of
      the assertion.  Specifications defining new assertion types MUST
      be registered their assertion type as a sub-type of
      'urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type'.  The
      'urn:ietf:params:oauth' registry and their sub-registries is
      defined in [I-D.ietf-oauth-urn-sub-ns].

   client_assertion:  REQUIRED.  The assertion being used to
      authenticate the client.  Specific serialization of the assertion
      is defined by profile documents.  The serialization MUST be
      encoded for transport within HTTP forms.  It is RECOMMENDED that
      base64url be used.

   The following non-normative example demonstrates a client
   authenticating using an assertion during an Authorization Token
   Request as defined in Section 4.1.3 of OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2]
   (with line breaks for display purposes only):

   POST /token HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com

   Token endpoints can differentiate between assertion based credentials
   and other client credential types by looking for the presence of the
   "client_assertion" and "client_assertion_type" parameters, which will
   only be present when using assertions for client authentication.

4.2.1.  Error Responses

   If an assertion is invalid for any reason or if more than one client
   authentication mechanism is used, the Authorization Server MUST
   construct an error response as defined in OAuth 2.0
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2].  The value of the "error" parameter MUST be the
   "invalid_client" error code.  The authorization server MAY include
   additional information regarding the reasons the client assertion was
   considered invalid using the "error_description" or "error_uri"
   parameters.

   For example:
   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
     "error":"invalid_client"
     "error_description":"Multiple Credentials Not Allowed"
   }


5.  Assertion Content and Processing

   This section provides a general content and processing model for the
   use of assertions in OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2].

5.1.  Generic Assertion Content and Processing Rules

   The following are entities and metadata involved in the issuance,
   exchange and processing of assertions in OAuth 2.0.  These are
   general terms, abstract from any particular assertion format.
   Mappings of these terms into specific representations are provided by
   profiles of this specification.

   Issuer:  REQUIRED.  The unique identifier for the entity that issued
      the assertion.  Generally this is the entity that holds the keying
      material used to compute a digital signature or a keyed message
      digest over the assertion.  In some use cases Issuers may be
      either OAuth clients (when assertions are self-created, see
      Figure 3) or obtained from a third party token service, see



Mortimore, et al.       Expires December 26, 2012              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft      Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0          June 2012


      Figure 2.  If the assertion is self-created, the Issuer SHOULD
      correspond to the content of the 'client_id'.  If the assertion is
      third party created, the Issuer MUST identify the third party.

   Principal:  OPTIONAL.  A unique identifier for the subject of the
      assertion.  The used value for the principal depends on whether
      the assertion is used for client authentication or as an
      authorization grant.

   Audience:  REQUIRED.  The assertion MUST contain an Audience element
      that identifies the Authorization Server as the intended audience
      using the Authorization Server's Token Endpoint URI.  The
      Authorization Server MUST verify that it is an intended audience
      for the assertion.

   Issued At:  OPTIONAL.  The time at which the assertion was issued.
      While the serialization may differ by assertion format, this is
      always expressed in UTC with no time zone component.

   Expires At:  REQUIRED.  The time at which the assertion expires.
      While the serialization may differ by assertion format, this is
      always expressed in UTC with no time zone component.  This field
      limits the time window during which the assertion can be used.
      The authorization server MUST verify that the expiration time has
      not passed, subject to allowable clock skew between systems.  The
      authorization server SHOULD reject assertions with an Expires At
      attribute value that is unreasonably far in the future.

   Assertion ID:  OPTIONAL.  A nonce or unique identifier for the
      assertion.  The Assertion ID may be used by implementations
      requiring message replay protection for one-time use assertions.
      Any entity that assigns an identifier MUST ensure that there is
      negligible probability that that entity or any other entity will
      accidentally assign the same identifier to a different data
      object.  An Authorization Server MAY dictate that Assertion ID is
      mandatory.

   An assertion MUST be either digitally signed or protected by a keyed
   message digest.  The relying party using the assertion as input to
   authorization decisions, namely the Authorization Server or the
   Resource Server, MUST verify the assertion's signature or keyed
   message digest in order to verify the Issuer of the assertion, and to
   prevent a number of attacks.

5.2.  Using Assertions for Client Authentication

   This section describes additional processing rules in addition to
   those listed in Section 5.1 when assertions are used for client



Mortimore, et al.       Expires December 26, 2012              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft      Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0          June 2012


   authentication:

   o  The "client_assertion_type" HTTP parameter MUST identify the
      assertion format being used for authentication.

   o  The "client_assertion" HTTP parameter MUST contain the serialized
      assertion in a format indicated by the "client_assertion_type"
      parameter.

   o  The Principal SHOULD be the "client_id".

   The following non-normative example demonstrates the use of a client
   authentication using an assertion during an Access Token Request as
   defined in Section 4.1.3 of OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] (with line
   breaks for display purposes only):

   POST /token HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   grant_type=authorization_code&
   code=i1WsRn1uB1&
   client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&
   client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth
   %3Aclient-assertion-type%3Asaml2-bearer&
   client_assertion=PHNhb...[omitted for brevity]...ZT4

5.3.  Using Assertions as Authorization Grants

   This section describes the processing rules when utilizing a
   authorization grant.

   o  The grant_type HTTP request parameter MUST indicate the assertion
      format.

   o  The assertion HTTP parameter MUST contain the serialized assertion
      as in a format indicated by the grant_type parameter.

   o  The Principal MUST identify an authorized accessor for whom the
      access token is being requested (typically the resource owner, or
      an authorized delegate).

   The following non-normative example demonstrates the use of an SAML2
   bearer assertion as an authorization grant with line breaks for
   display purposes only:

   POST /token HTTP/1.1

   client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&
   grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Asaml2-bearer&
   assertion=PHNhbWxwOl...[omitted for brevity]...ZT


6.  Examples

   This section provides additional examples.  As described in Section 1
   assertions for client authentication can be used in concert with
   various authorization grant types, including those defined in OAuth
   2.0 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2].

6.1.  Client Credentials Authorization Grant using Assertions

   This section illustrates the combination of the Client Credentials
   grant with assertions for client authentication.  Section 4.4 of
   OAuth 2.0 [I-D.ietf-oauth-v2] describes the Client Credentials grant
   as follows:

      "The client can request an access token using only its client A
      credentials (or other supported means of authentication) when the
      A  client is requesting access to the protected resources under
      its A  control, or those of another resource owner which has been
      previously A  arranged with the authorization server (the method
      of which is beyond A  the scope of this specification)."

   To combine the Client Credentials grant with the client
   authentication using assertions defined in this document the
   'grant_type' field is set to "client_credentials" and the
   'client_assertion' and the 'client_assertion_type' fields are added.
   Line breaks are added for display purposes only.
   POST /token HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&
   grant_type=client_credentials&
   client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth
   %3Aclient-assertion-type%3Asaml2-bearer&
   client_assertion=PHNhbW...[omitted for brevity]...ZT

6.2.  Hybrid Client Authentication and Authorization Grant

   This section describes a special case that combines assertion-based
   client authentication with the assertion authorization grant.
   Consequently, two assertions are used within the same message.
   POST /token HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Asaml2-bearer&
   assertion=PHNhbWxwOl...[omitted for brevity]...ZT4&
   client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&
   client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth
   %3Aclient-assertion-type%3Asaml2-bearer&
   client_assertion=PHNaabW...[omitted for brevity]...ZT


7.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses security considerations when using assertions
   with OAuth 2.0 as proposed in this document.  As described in
   Section 3 there are two different ways to obtain assertions, either
   as self-created assertions as well as assertions obtained from third
   party token services.  While the actual interactions for obtaining
   these assertions is outside the scope of this document from a
   security point of view these details matter and Section 3 addresses
   these high level architectural aspects.

   The rest of this section focuses on the exchanges that concerns
   presenting an assertion for client authentication and for the
   authorization grant.

7.1.  Forged Assertion

   Threat:

      An adversary could forge or alter an assertion in order to obtain
      an access token (in case of the authorization grant) or to
      impersonate a client (in case of the client authentication
      mechanism).

   Countermeasures:

      To avoid this kind of attack, the entities must assure that proper
      mechanisms for protecting any assertion are employed.  This
      includes digitally signing the assertion by the issuer or to
      compute a keyed message digest over the assertion.  Furthermore,
      in cases where the client is merely passing the assertion obtained



Mortimore, et al.       Expires December 26, 2012              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft      Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0          June 2012


      from a third party token service onwards the transport of the
      assertion must happen over a secure channel after the client
      authenticated the intented recipient.

7.2.  Stolen Assertion

   Threat:

      An adversary may be able obtain an assertion (e.g., by
      eavesdropping) and to then re-use it (replay it) at a later point
      in time.

   Countermeasures:

      An assertion may contain several elements to prevent replay
      attacks.  There is, however, a clear tradeoff between re-using an
      assertion for multiple exchanges and obtaining and creating new
      fresh assertions.

      Authorization Servers and Resource Servers may use a combination
      of the Assertion ID and Issued At/Expires At attributes for replay
      protection.  Previously processed assertions may be rejected based
      on the Assertion ID.  The addition of the validity window relieves
      the authorization server from maintaining an infinite state table
      of processed assertion IDs.

7.3.  Unauthorized Disclosure of Personal Information

   Threat:

      The ability for other entities to obtain additional information
      about an individual, such as authentication information, role in
      an organization or other authorization relevant information raises
      privacy concerns.

   Countermeasures:

      To address the threats two cases need to be differentiated.

      First, a third party that did not participate in any of the
      exchange is prevented from eavesdropping on the content of the
      assertion by employing confidentiality protection of the HTTP
      signaling exchange using TLS.  This ensures that an eavesdropper
      on the wire is unable to obtain information.  However, this does
      not prevent legitimate protocol entities from obtaining
      information assertion they may not have been allowed to obtain.

      Second, an Authorization Server may obtain an assertion that was



Mortimore, et al.       Expires December 26, 2012              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft      Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0          June 2012


      created by a third party token service and that token service may
      have placed attributes into the assertion.  To mitigate potential
      privacy problems prior consent from the resource owner has to be
      obtained and OAuth itself provides such capabilities but this
      consent approval may be obtained using other identity management
      protocols or in an out-of-band fashion.  In other cases it may be
      more appropriate to omit information identifying the resource
      owner, as a data subject, from the assertion content.  For
      example, the name or the email address of the data subject may not
      be necessary for executing the authorization decision and certain
      attributes (e.g., data subject is older than 18 years) may be used
      instead.

      For the cases where a third party token service creates assertions
      for usage with client authentication privacy concerns are
      typically lower since many of these clients are Web servers rather
      than individual devices operated by humans.  If the assertions are
      used for client authentication of devices or software that can be
      closely linked to end users then privacy protection safeguards
      need to be taken into consideration.

      Further guidance on privacy friendly protocol design can be found
      in [I-D.iab-privacy-considerations].

      few examples because both known derivative specs, SAML and JWT,
      omit the padding char in serialization/encoding.

   o  Remove section 7 on error responses and move that (somewhat
      modified) content into subsections of section 4 broken up by
      authn/authz per
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/oauth/current/msg08735.html.

      and
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/oauth/current/msg08749.html.

   o  Change "The Principal MUST identify an authorized accessor.  If
      the assertion is self-issued, the Principal SHOULD be the

      in 4.1 and remove the client_id bullet from 4.2 per
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/oauth/current/msg08875.html.

   o  Add ref to Section 3.3 of oauth-v2 for scope definition and remove
      some then redundant text per
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/oauth/current/msg08890.html.

   o  Change "The following format and processing rules SHOULD be
      applied" to "The following format and processing rules apply" in
