== IPv6 Privacy Questionnaire == 

This IPv6 privacy questionnaire aims to capture current implementation and deployment situation of IPv6 privacy mechanisms. The data collected with this survey will be used in a publically available writeup. 

 
1) Name and version of the IP stack in your operating system 
_______________

2) Where is your IP stack/operating system typically used? 
_______________

3) Does your IP stack/operating system support IPv6? 
 __ yes
 __ no

(If the answer is "no" stop here.)

4) Do you enable IPv6 per default? 
 __ yes
 __ no

5) What mechanisms for IPv6 interface identifier configuration do you support? 
 __ Manual configuration 
 __ Link layer identifier, such as MAC address (RFC 1972/RFC 2464) 
 __ Randomly generated temporary addresses (RFC 3041/RFC 4941) 
 __ Cryptographically generated addresses (RFC 3972)
 __ Network provided interface identifier (e.g., 3GPP networks or PPP provide IID to the end host - RFC 5072)
 __ DHCPv6 (RFC 3315) / IKEv2 (RFC 5739)

6) Which interface identifier configuration mechanism(s) is(are) set by *default*? 
_______________

7) At what interval is the interface identifier changed (per *default*) for the following mechanisms? 
   (Indicate time, if applicable)
 _____ Randomly generated temporary addresses (RFC 3041/RFC 4941) 
 _____ Cryptographically generated addresses (RFC 3972)
 _____ Network provided interface identifier (e.g., 3GPP networks or PPP provide IID to the end host - RFC 5072)
 _____ DHCPv6 (RFC 3315)

8) Which IPv4/IPv6 transition mechanism that embedded IPv4 addresses in IPv6 addresses do you implement?
 __ Teredo based on RFC 4380
 __ Teredo based on RFC 5991 
 __ 6to4 (RFC 3056)
 __ 6RD (RFC 5569)
 __ ISATAP (RFC 5214) 
 __ RFC 6052 addresses (as, for example, used by NAT64)
 __ others, namely ______ 

9) Do you have documentation on how an end user can change the interface identifier configuration mechanism, and the default settings? 
 __ yes
 __ no

 If the answer is "yes" please provide a pointer to the documentation for us to look at.
_______________

10) Address Selection Procedure 

RFC 3484 specifies that public addresses be used for outbound
connections unless an application explicitly prefers temporary
addresses. The default preference for public addresses was established
to avoid applications potentially failing due to the short lifetime of
temporary addresses or the possibility of a reverse look-up failure or
error. However, RFC 3484 allowed that "implementations for which
privacy considerations outweigh these application compatibility
concerns MAY reverse the sense of this rule and by default prefer
temporary addresses over public addresses."

What is the default policy in your IP stack?
 __ Prefer temporary addresses over public addresses.
 __ Prefer public addresses over temporary addresses. 

11) Can the default address selection policy be changed by the user? 
 __ yes
 __ no

 If the answer is "yes" please provide a pointer to the documentation for us to look at.
_______________
  
12) Do you allow multiple temporary addresses to be used at the same time? 
 __ no, only a single one 
 __ yes, but there is a limit with ___
 __ yes, there is no limit
 
13) While the previous questions refer to implementation aspects there is the question about deployment status. 
Can you share information about the deployment situation with us? What mechanisms do your customers use?
_______________

14) From your discussions with others have you encountered privacy concerns that are worth sharing with us?
_______________
