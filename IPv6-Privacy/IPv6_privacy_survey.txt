== IPv6 Privacy Questionnaire == 

This IPv6 privacy questionnaire aims to capture current implementation and deployment situation of IPv6 privacy mechanisms. The data collected with this survey will be used in a publically available writeup. 

 
1) Name and version of the operating system 
____________________________________________

2) In what type of device or operational environments is your operating system typically used? 
____________________________________________

3) Does your operating system support IPv6? 
 __ yes
 __ yes, with constraints __________________________
 __ no
 
(If the answer is "no" stop here.)

4) Do you enable IPv6 per default? 
 __ yes
 __ yes, with constraints __________________________ 
 __ no

5) What mechanisms for IPv6 interface identifier configuration do you support? 
 __ Manual configuration 
 __ Link layer identifier, such as MAC address (RFC 1972/RFC 2464) 
 __ Randomly generated temporary addresses (RFC 3041/RFC 4941) 
 __ Cryptographically generated addresses (RFC 3972)
 __ Network provided interface identifier (e.g., 3GPP networks or PPP provide IID to the end host - RFC 5072)
 __ DHCPv6 (RFC 3315) / IKEv2 (RFC 5739)
 __ others, namely ______

6) Which interface identifier configuration mechanism(s) is(are) set by *default*? 
 __ Manual configuration 
 __ Link layer identifier, such as MAC address (RFC 1972/RFC 2464) 
 __ Randomly generated temporary addresses (RFC 3041/RFC 4941) 
 __ Cryptographically generated addresses (RFC 3972)
 __ Network provided interface identifier (e.g., 3GPP networks or PPP provide IID to the end host - RFC 5072)
 __ DHCPv6 (RFC 3315) / IKEv2 (RFC 5739)
 __ others, namely ______

7) At what interval is the interface identifier changed (per *default*) for the following mechanisms? 
   (Indicate time, if possible/applicable)
 __________ Randomly generated temporary addresses (RFC 3041/RFC 4941) 
 __________ Cryptographically generated addresses (RFC 3972)
 __________ Network provided interface identifier (e.g., 3GPP networks or PPP provide IID to the end host - RFC 5072)
 __________ DHCPv6 (RFC 3315)
 __________ others, namely ______ 

8) Which IPv4/IPv6 transition mechanism(s) that embeds IPv4 in IPv6 addresses do you implement?
 __ Teredo based on RFC 4380
 __ Teredo based on RFC 5991 
 __ 6to4 (RFC 3056)
 __ 6RD (RFC 5569)
 __ ISATAP (RFC 5214) 
 __ RFC 6052 addresses (as, for example, used by NAT64)
 __ others, namely ______ 

9) Which transition mechanim(s) is(are) enabled by *default*? 
 __ Teredo based on RFC 4380
 __ Teredo based on RFC 5991 
 __ 6to4 (RFC 3056)
 __ 6RD (RFC 5569)
 __ ISATAP (RFC 5214) 
 __ RFC 6052 addresses (as, for example, used by NAT64)
 __ others, namely ______ 

10) Do you have documentation on how an end user can change the interface identifier configuration mechanism? 
 __ yes
 __ no

 If the answer is "yes" please provide a pointer to the documentation for us to look at.
_______________

11) Address Selection Procedure 

RFC 3484 specifies that public addresses be used for outbound
connections unless an application explicitly prefers temporary
addresses. The default preference for public addresses was established
to avoid applications potentially failing due to the short lifetime of
temporary addresses or the possibility of a reverse look-up failure or
error. However, RFC 3484 allows that "implementations for which
privacy considerations outweigh these application compatibility
concerns MAY reverse the sense of this rule and by default prefer
temporary addresses over public addresses."

What is the default policy in your IP stack?
 __ Prefer temporary addresses over public addresses.
 __ Prefer public addresses over temporary addresses. 
 __ Not applicable 
 
12) Can the default address selection policy be changed by the user? 
 __ yes
 __ no
 __ not applicable 

 If the answer is "yes" please provide a pointer to the documentation for us to look at.
_______________
  
13) Do you allow multiple temporary addresses per interface/per prefix to be used at the same time? 
 __ no, only one 
 __ yes, but there is a limit with ___
 __ not applicable 

14) Any remarks you would like to share with us?
