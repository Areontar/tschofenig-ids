                     ECRIT Direct Emergency Calling
                 draft-winterbottom-ecrit-direct-02.txt

Abstract

   The specified IETF emergency services architecture puts a strong
   emphasis on emergency call and emergency messaging via the Voice
   Service Provider (VSP) / Application Service Provider (ASP).  There
   are two reasons for this design decision: The call routing via the
   VSP/ASP is more natural as it follows the standard communication
   pattern and transition deployments assume non-updated end hosts.

   As the deployment of the Location-to-Service Translation protocol
   progresses there are possibilities for upgraded end devices to
   directly communicate with the IP-based emergency services network
   without the need to interact with a VSP/ASP, which simplifies the
   task of regulators as the involved parties are within the same
   jurisdiction.

   This memo describes the procedures and operations of a generic
   emergency calling client utilizing the available building blocks.

1.  Introduction

   The description of the IETF emergency services architecture, found in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] and in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-framework], focuses
   on devices where emergency calls are routed primarily through the
   subscriber's home VSP and the direct signaling communication between
   the end host and the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) that
   contains the IP-based PSAP is only an exception.  This is a
   convenient assumption if one considers the regular communication
   patterns of the device and the potential proprietary protocol
   implementations used between the end host and the VSP and the ability
   to move the interoperability challenges away from the end device and
   closer to VSPs.  There are, however, challenges for regulators to
   enforce emergency services functionality when the VSP is located in a
   different jurisdiction.  Inclusion of a VSP introduces unnecessary
   elements into the emergency call path making the overall solution
   more cumbersome.

   With the help of the Location-to-Service Translation protocol a PSAP
   URI is discovered that allows the end device to directly send SIP
   communication requests towards the PSAP.

   Note that the information returned by LoST may not necessarily be the
   address of the PSAP itself but might rather be an entity that gets
   the emergency call closer to the PSAP by returning the address of an
   Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP).

   The intent of this client is that it will be able to use the
   available ECRIT building blocks to allow any IP enabled device with
   access to the Internet to make an emergency call without requiring
   the signaling interaction with the VSP.  In fact, there is no
   assumption or requirement for a VSP subscription to exist.  The
   interacting entities are shown in Figure 1.

3.  The Jurisdictional Problem

   The jurisdictional problem is illustrated with Figure 2 that
   highlights that provided the data in the Location Information Server
   (LIS) and the LoST server are correct, that the caller and the PSAP
   are assured of being in the same regulatory jurisdiction.  This is
   important, because it shows that it is the access component of the
   network and not the service component against which reguatory
   obligations can be imposed with any hope of enforcement.  Regulation
   without the possibility of enforcement is challenging as there is
   very little coordination between regulators world wide in this area,
   consequently any emergency calling procedure should ensure that all
   nodes against which the procedures apply fall within the same
   regulatory boundary.

4.  ESRP Route Determination

   The ESRP is discovered by the emergency client obtaing its location
   from a LIS, for example, using HELD, and then using LoST to resolve
   the location and 'urn:services.sos' Service URN to the ESRP URI.

   When the emergency client is started the device needs to perform LIS
   and LoST server discovery, as described in Section 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp].

   The emergency client MUST support location acquisition and the LCPs
   described in Section 6.5 of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp].  The
   description in Section 6.5 and 6.6 of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp]
   regarding the interaction between the device and the LIS applies to
   this document.

   The emergency client MUST use LoST [RFC5222] to obtain an ESRP URI.
   The exact timing of individual LoST lookups may vary based on a
   number of factors, including the design of the user interface.  For
   example, a hypothetical user interface may offer an emergency call
   button that triggers a <listServicesByLocation> interaction to learn
   about the available emergency services (potentially using the
   serviceListBoundary extension defined in [RFC6197]).  The service
   options may be presented to the emergency caller in a graphical
   fashion and once a specific service is selected a LoST query would be
   initiated (unless a cached mapping is available that makes this
   request obsolete).  The LoST <findService> query to obtain the ESRP
   URI for the selected service is in this example initiated at the time
   the emergency call setup is performed.  It is recommended that ESRP
   discovery occurs at call time.

5.  Emergency Client Registration

   Emergency registration is only necessary when an emergency call
   procedure is initiated.  Immediately prior to making an emergency
   call, the emergency client performs a SIP emergency registration with
   the registrar in the ESRP, the ESRP-registrar.  The emergency
   registration is a SIP registration with specific options and headers
   which are required in order to guard the emergency network and ensure
   callback should it be required.

   Each emergency client MUST provide an instance-id, as defined in
   [RFC5626], this allows the ESRP-registrar to generate a GRUU
   [RFC5627] that can be used as a callback identifier.  A GRUU is
   necessary as the callback identifier because the emergency client
   does not provide a longer-term contact address to the ESRP-registrar
   prior to registration, and the GRUU provides a handle by which the
   PSAP can identify the calling emergency client.  To simplify the
   emergency client and ESRP-registrar implementations, only public
   GRUUs are provided by the ESRP-registrar.  The public GRUU is
   guaranteed to be the same for a device regardless of re-registration
   with a different call-id, which may occur if the device unexpectedly
   reboots.  This is not true for temporary GRUUs, which makes temporary
   GRUUs undesriable in the scope of this application space.

   The PSAP is able to define and mandate the time over which callback
   is possible.  This needs to be a reasonable period of time, nominally
   10s of minutes, as the device may well be transient with regards to
   network attachment.  The ESRP-registrar reflects the regulatory
   callback period in the expiry value of emergency registration
   responses.  Emergency clients claiming compliance to this
   specification MUST honour the value in the registration response from
   the ESRP-registrar, up to a maximum of 60 minutes.  An emergency
   client SHOULD respect a registration expiry of longer than 60
   minutes, but MAY terminate its registration with and ESRP-registrar
   at 60 minutes if the expiry value provided by the ESRP-registrar was
   longer.

   In the event that a registration is lost by the emergency client
   prior to reaching registration expiry then the emergency client MUST
   re-register with the ESRP-registrar and SHOULD use the same call-id.
   In this circumstance the ESRP-registrar SHOULD match the instance-id
   and the call-id to recognize that it is a re-registration for a
   dropped connection, and expiry time in the registration response
   SHOULD be set to the time remaining when the original registration
   occurred.

   [RFC5626] requires a device to support at least 2 registrations to
   different proxies.  The emergency client requirements in this memo

   relax this requirement down to one registration, but more than one is
   allowed.  There are several reasons for relaxing the connection
   redundancy requirement.  Firstly, ESRPs are expected to have inbuilt
   redundancy, so if a connection is dropped due to a failed proxy in
   the ESRP, then a new connection or registration will automatically be
   directed to an active proxy in the ESRP cluster.  If the connection
   dropped because of some other failure along the path from the
   emergency client to the ESRP, then multiple SIP registrations are
   unlikely to provide any measurable reliability improvements since
   single points of failure in this path are inherently likely.
   Secondly, re-registrations only occur immediately prior to call
   placement, so any outbound failure will also likely result in the
   call dropping.  If this occurs then the emergency client MUST re-
   register with the ESRP-registrar, and since instance-id and public
   GRUU will remain unchanged as a result of this, the emergency client
   can either receive a callback from the PSAP, or it can initiate a new
   call to the emergency network.

   Location information is critical to emergency calling.  Providing
   location information to the calling-entity with sufficient
   granularity to allow ESRP route determination is crucial.  Since this
   must occur prior to the emergency client registering with the ESRP-
   registrar, the emergency client must have access to a certain amount
   of location information (and the amount varies depending on the
   specific emergency services deployment architecture).

   The device SHOULD include all the location information it has when
   registering with the ERSP-registrar.  Inclusion of location
   information in SIP REGISTER messages is specified in [RFC6442].
   There are three possible execution paths for the ESRP-registrar when
   receiving a REGISTER message:

   1.  If the REGISTER message does not include location information the
       ESRP-registrar MUST use HELD identity [RFC6155] to obtain the
       location of the device as both a location value and reference.
       In order to contact the LIS the ESRP-registrar SHOULD determine
       the LIS address using the mechanism described in
       [I-D.ietf-geopriv-res-gw-lis-discovery].  The ESRP-registrar MAY
       use other methods for LIS determination where available.

   2.  If the REGISTER message contains a location URI then the ESRP-
       registrar MUST dereference it so that it has a location available
       to route the impending emergency call.  The ESRP-registrar MAY
       validate the LIS address in the location URI with that of the LIS
       serving the network from which the REGISTER message originated.

   3.  The REGISTER message contains location information by value.  Any
       actions performed by the ESRP-registrar to valid this information

   be provided using Transport Layer Security (TLS).

   2.  The To header MUST be a service URN in the "sos" tree.

   3.  The From header MUST be present and MUST be the public GRUU
       returned from the registration with the ESRP-registrar.

   4.  A Route header MUST be present with an ESRP URI, obtained from
       LoST.

   5.  A Contact header MUST be present and contain the public GRUU
       [RFC5627], and be valid for several minutes following the
       termination of the call, provided that the UAC remains registered
       with the same registrar, to permit an immediate call-back to the
       specific device which placed the emergency call.

   6.  A SDP offer MUST be included in the INVITE.  If voice is
       supported the offer MUST include the G.711 codec, see Section 14
       of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp].

   7.  SIP Caller Preferences [RFC3841] SHOULD be used to signal how the
       PSAP should handle the call.  For example, a language preference
       expressed in an Accept-Language header may be used as a hint to
       cause the PSAP to route the call to a call taker who speaks the
       requested language.  SIP Caller Preferences may also be used to
       indicate a need to invoke a relay service for communication with
       people with disabilities in the call.

7.  SIP Feature Restrictions

   The functionality defined in Section 9.3 in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp]
   regarding disabling of certain features is relevant for this document
   and an emergency client MUST NOT implement the the features listed in
   ED-70, and ED-71.

8.  Testing

   The description in Section 15 of [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] regarding
   emergency call testing is used by this specification.  Since this
   specification mandates a registration with the ESRP-registrar a
   similar tagging URI to that described in
   [I-D.patel-ecrit-sos-parameter] is used to indicate a test
   registration.

   Test registrations SHALL be of short durations, but MUST be long
   enough to allow completion of a "test call" as described in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp].

8.1.  Test Registration

   When the emergency client sends a REGISTER request for emergency test
   registration, the "sos.test" URI parameter MUST be appended to the
   URI in the Contact header.  This indicates to the ESRP-registrar that
   the request is for emergency test registration.


      ...
         Contact: <sip:anon@192.0.2.2;transport=tcp;sos.test>
       ;+sip.instance="<urn:uuid:00000000-0000-1000-8000-AABBCCDDEEFF>"
      Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=boundary1
      Content-Length: ...


                 Figure 5: Test REGISTER Message Fragment

   Only one Contact header field SHOULD be included in the emergency
   REGISTER test request.  If more than one Contact header is included
   then the presence of the "sos.test" URI in any of the Contact fields
   SHALL result in the ESRP-registrar treating the registration as a
   test registration.

8.2.  Format

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in [RFC5234].

   The "sos.test" URI parameter is a "uri-parameter", as defined by
   [RFC3261].

   uri-parameter =/ sos-param-test

   sos-param-test = "sos.test"

11.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines one new SIP URI parameter, as per the
   registry created by [RFC3969].

   Parameter Name: sos.test

   Predefined Values: none

   Reference: [RFCXXXX]

   [NOTE TO IANA: Please replace XXXX with the RFC number of this
   specification.]
